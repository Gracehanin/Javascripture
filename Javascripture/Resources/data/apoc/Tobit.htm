The Book of Tobit
</h1><p>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,1);</script>The book of the words of
Tobit, son of Tobiel, the son of Ananiel, the son of Aduel, the son of
Gabael, of the seed of Asael, of the tribe of Nephthali;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,2);</script>Who in the time of
Enemessar king of the Assyrians was led captive out of Thisbe, which is at
the right hand of that city, which is called properly Nephthali in Galilee
above Aser.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,3);</script>I Tobit have walked all
the days of my life in the ways of truth and justice, and I did many
almsdeeds to my brethren, and my nation, who came with me to Nineve, into
the land of the Assyrians.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,4);</script>And when I was in mine
own country, in the land of Israel being but young, all the tribe of
Nephthali my father fell from the house of Jerusalem, which was chosen out
of all the tribes of Israel, that all the tribes should sacrifice there,
where the temple of the habitation of the most High was consecrated and
built for all ages.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,5);</script>Now all the tribes
which together revolted, and the house of my father Nephthali, sacrificed
unto the heifer Baal.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,6);</script>But I alone went often
to Jerusalem at the feasts, as it was ordained unto all the people of
Israel by an everlasting decree, having the firstfruits and tenths of
increase, with that which was first shorn; and them gave I at the altar to
the priests the children of Aaron.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,7);</script>The first tenth part of
all increase I gave to the sons of Aaron, who ministered at Jerusalem:
another tenth part I sold away, and went, and spent it every year at
Jerusalem:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,8);</script>And the third I gave
unto them to whom it was meet, as Debora my father’s mother had
commanded me, because I was left an orphan by my father.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,9);</script>Furthermore, when I was
come to the age of a man, I married Anna of mine own kindred, and of her I
begat Tobias.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,10);</script>And when we were
carried away captives to Nineve, all my brethren and those that were of my
kindred did eat of the bread of the Gentiles.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,11);</script>But I kept myself from
eating;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,12);</script>Because I remembered
God with all my heart.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,13);</script>And the most High gave
me grace and favour before Enemessar, so that I was his purveyor.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,14);</script>And I went into Media,
and left in trust with Gabael, the brother of Gabrias, at Rages a city of
Media ten talents of silver.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,15);</script>Now when Enemessar was
dead, Sennacherib his son reigned in his stead; whose estate was troubled,
that I could not go into Media.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,16);</script>And in the time of
Enemessar I gave many alms to my brethren, and gave my bread to the hungry,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,17);</script>And my clothes to the
naked: and if I saw any of my nation dead, or cast about the walls of
Nineve, I buried him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,18);</script>And if the king
Sennacherib had slain any, when he was come, and fled from Judea, I buried
them privily; for in his wrath he killed many; but the bodies were not
found, when they were sought for of the king.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,19);</script>And when one of the
Ninevites went and complained of me to the king, that I buried them, and
hid myself; understanding that I was sought for to be put to death, I
withdrew myself for fear.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,20);</script>Then all my goods were
forcibly taken away, neither was there any thing left me, beside my wife
Anna and my son Tobias.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,21);</script>And there passed not
five and fifty days, before two of his sons killed him, and they fled into
the mountains of Ararath; and Sarchedonus his son reigned in his stead;
who appointed over his father’s accounts, and over all his affairs,
Achiacharus my brother Anael’s son.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,22);</script>And Achiacharus
intreating for me, I returned to Nineve. Now Achiacharus was cupbearer,
and keeper of the signet, and steward, and overseer of the accounts: and
Sarchedonus appointed him next unto him: and he was my brother’s son.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,1);</script>Now when I was come
home again, and my wife Anna was restored unto me, with my son Tobias, in
the feast of Pentecost, which is the holy feast of the seven weeks, there
was a good dinner prepared me, in the which I sat down to eat.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,2);</script>And when I saw
abundance of meat, I said to my son, Go and bring what poor man soever
thou shalt find out of our brethren, who is mindful of the Lord; and, lo,
I tarry for thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,3);</script>But he came again, and
said, Father, one of our nation is strangled, and is cast out in the
marketplace.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,4);</script>Then before I had
tasted of any meat, I started up, and took him up into a room until the
going down of the sun.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,5);</script>Then I returned, and
washed myself, and ate my meat in heaviness,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,6);</script>Remembering that
prophecy of Amos, as he said, Your feasts shall be turned into mourning,
and all your mirth into lamentation.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,7);</script>Therefore I wept: and
after the going down of the sun I went and made a grave, and buried him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,8);</script>But my neighbours
mocked me, and said, This man is not yet afraid to be put to death for
this matter: who fled away; and yet, lo, he burieth the dead again.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,9);</script>The same night also I
returned from the burial, and slept by the wall of my courtyard, being
polluted and my face was uncovered:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,10);</script>And I knew not that
there were sparrows in the wall, and mine eyes being open, the sparrows
muted warm dung into mine eyes, and a whiteness came in mine eyes: and I
went to the physicians, but they helped me not: moreover Achiacharus did
nourish me, until I went into Elymais.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,11);</script>And my wife Anna did
take women’s works to do.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,12);</script>And when she had sent
them home to the owners, they paid her wages, and gave her also besides a
kid.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,13);</script>And when it was in my
house, and began to cry, I said unto her, From whence is this kid? is it
not stolen? render it to the owners; for it is not lawful to eat any thing
that is stolen.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,14);</script>But she replied upon
me, It was given for a gift more than the wages. Howbeit I did not believe
her, but bade her render it to the owners: and I was abashed at her. But
she replied upon me, Where are thine alms and thy righteous deeds? behold,
thou and all thy works are known.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,1);</script>Then I being grieved
did weep, and in my sorrow prayed, saying,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,2);</script>O Lord, thou art just,
and all thy works and all thy ways are mercy and truth, and thou judgest
truly and justly for ever.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,3);</script>Remember me, and look
on me, punish me not for my sins and ignorances, and the sins of my
fathers, who have sinned before thee:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,4);</script>For they obeyed not thy
commandments: wherefore thou hast delivered us for a spoil, and unto
captivity, and unto death, and for a proverb of reproach to all the
nations among whom we are dispersed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,5);</script>And now thy judgments
are many and true: deal with me according to my sins and my fathers’:
because we have not kept thy commandments, neither have walked in truth
before thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,6);</script>Now therefore deal with
me as seemeth best unto thee, and command my spirit to be taken from me,
that I may be dissolved, and become earth: for it is profitable for me to
die rather than to live, because I have heard false reproaches, and have
much sorrow: command therefore that I may now be delivered out of this
distress, and go into the everlasting place: turn not thy face away from
me.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,7);</script>It came to pass the
same day, that in Ecbatane a city of Media Sara the daughter of Raguel was
also reproached by her father’s maids;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,8);</script>Because that she had
been married to seven husbands, whom Asmodeus the evil spirit had killed,
before they had lain with her. Dost thou not know, said they, that thou
hast strangled thine husbands? thou hast had already seven husbands,
neither wast thou named after any of them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,9);</script>Wherefore dost thou
beat us for them? if they be dead, go thy ways after them, let us never
see of thee either son or daughter.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,10);</script>Whe she heard these
things, she was very sorrowful, so that she thought to have strangled
herself; and she said, I am the only daughter of my father, and if I do
this, it shall be a reproach unto him, and I shall bring his old age with
sorrow unto the grave.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,11);</script>Then she prayed toward
the window, and said, Blessed art thou, O Lord my God, and thine holy and
glorious name is blessed and honourable for ever: let all thy works praise
thee for ever.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,12);</script>And now, O Lord, I set
mine eyes and my face toward thee,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,13);</script>And say, Take me out
of the earth, that I may hear no more the reproach.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,14);</script>Thou knowest, Lord,
that I am pure from all sin with man,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,15);</script>And that I never
polluted my name, nor the name of my father, in the land of my captivity:
I am the only daughter of my father, neither hath he any child to be his
heir, neither any near kinsman, nor any son of his alive, to whom I may
keep myself for a wife: my seven husbands are already dead; and why should
I live? but if it please not thee that I should die, command some regard
to be had of me, and pity taken of me, that I hear no more reproach.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,16);</script>So the prayers of them
both were heard before the majesty of the great God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,17);</script>And Raphael was sent
to heal them both, that is, to scale away the whiteness of Tobit’s eyes,
and to give Sara the daughter of Raguel for a wife to Tobias the son of
Tobit; and to bind Asmodeus the evil spirit; because she belonged to
Tobias by right of inheritance. The selfsame time came Tobit home, and
entered into his house, and Sara the daughter of Raguel came down from her
upper chamber.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,1);</script>In that day Tobit
remembered the money which he had committed to Gabael in Rages of Media,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,2);</script>And said with himself,
I have wished for death; wherefore do I not call for my son Tobias that I
may signify to him of the money before I die?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,3);</script>And when he had called
him, he said, My son, when I am dead, bury me; and despise not thy mother,
but honour her all the days of thy life, and do that which shall please
her, and grieve her not.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,4);</script>Remember, my son, that
she saw many dangers for thee, when thou wast in her womb: and when she is
dead, bury her by me in one grave.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,5);</script>My son, be mindful of
the Lord our God all thy days, and let not thy will be set to sin, or to
transgress his commandments: do uprightly all thy life long, and follow
not the ways of unrighteousness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,6);</script>For if thou deal truly,
thy doings shall prosperously succeed to thee, and to all them that live
justly.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,7);</script>Give alms of thy
substance; and when thou givest alms, let not thine eye be envious,
neither turn thy face from any poor, and the face of God shall not be
turned away from thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,8);</script>If thou hast abundance
give alms accordingly: if thou have but a little, be not afraid to give
according to that little:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,9);</script>For thou layest up a
good treasure for thyself against the day of necessity.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,10);</script>Because that alms do
deliver from death, and suffereth not to come into darkness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,11);</script>For alms is a good
gift unto all that give it in the sight of the most High.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,12);</script>Beware of all
whoredom, my son, and chiefly take a wife of the seed of thy fathers, and
take not a strange woman to wife, which is not of thy father’s tribe:
for we are the children of the prophets, Noe, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob:
remember, my son, that our fathers from the beginning, even that they all
married wives of their own kindred, and were blessed in their children,
and their seed shall inherit the land.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,13);</script>Now therefore, my son,
love thy brethren, and despise not in thy heart thy brethren, the sons and
daughters of thy people, in not taking a wife of them: for in pride is
destruction and much trouble, and in lewdness is decay and great want: for
lewdness is the mother of famine.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,14);</script>Let not the wages of
any man, which hath wrought for thee, tarry with thee, but give him it out
of hand: for if thou serve God, he will also repay thee: be circumspect my
son, in all things thou doest, and be wise in all thy conversation.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,15);</script>Do that to no man
which thou hatest: drink not wine to make thee drunken: neither let
drunkenness go with thee in thy journey.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,16);</script>Give of thy bread to
the hungry, and of thy garments to them that are naked; and according to
thine abundance give alms: and let not thine eye be envious, when thou
givest alms.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,17);</script>Pour out thy bread on
the burial of the just, but give nothing to the wicked.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,18);</script>Ask counsel of all
that are wise, and despise not any counsel that is profitable.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,19);</script>Bless the Lord thy God
alway, and desire of him that thy ways may be directed, and that all thy
paths and counsels may prosper: for every nation hath not counsel; but the
Lord himself giveth all good things, and he humbleth whom he will, as he
will; now therefore, my son, remember my commandments, neither let them be
put out of thy mind.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,20);</script>And now I signify this
to they that I committed ten talents to Gabael the son of Gabrias at Rages
in Media.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,21);</script>And fear not, my son,
that we are made poor: for thou hast much wealth, if thou fear God, and
depart from all sin, and do that which is pleasing in his sight.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,1);</script>Tobias then answered
and said, Father, I will do all things which thou hast commanded me:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,2);</script>But how can I receive
the money, seeing I know him not?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,3);</script>Then he gave him the
handwriting, and said unto him, Seek thee a man which may go with thee,
whiles I yet live, and I will give him wages: and go and receive the money.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,4);</script>Therefore when he went
to seek a man, he found Raphael that was an angel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,5);</script>But he knew not; and he
said unto him, Canst thou go with me to Rages? and knowest thou those
places well?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,6);</script>To whom the angel said,
I will go with thee, and I know the way well: for I have lodged with our
brother Gabael.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,7);</script>Then Tobias said unto
him, Tarry for me, till I tell my father.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,8);</script>Then he said unto him,
Go and tarry not. So he went in and said to his father, Behold, I have
found one which will go with me. Then he said, Call him unto me, that I
may know of what tribe he is, and whether he be a trusty man to go with
thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,9);</script>So he called him, and
he came in, and they saluted one another.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,10);</script>Then Tobit said unto
him, Brother, shew me of what tribe and family thou art.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,11);</script>To whom he said, Dost
thou seek for a tribe or family, or an hired man to go with thy son? Then
Tobit said unto him, I would know, brother, thy kindred and name.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,12);</script>Then he said, I am
Azarias, the son of Ananias the great, and of thy brethren.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,13);</script>Then Tobit said, Thou
art welcome, brother; be not now angry with me, because I have enquired to
know thy tribe and thy family; for thou art my brother, of an honest and
good stock: for I know Ananias and Jonathas, sons of that great Samaias,
as we went together to Jerusalem to worship, and offered the firstborn,
and the tenths of the fruits; and they were not seduced with the error of
our brethren: my brother, thou art of a good stock.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,14);</script>But tell me, what
wages shall I give thee? wilt thou a drachm a day, and things necessary,
as to mine own son?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,15);</script>Yea, moreover, if ye
return safe, I will add something to thy wages.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,16);</script>So they were well
pleased. Then said he to Tobias, Prepare thyself for the journey, and God
send you a good journey. And when his son had prepared all things for the
journey, his father said, Go thou with this man, and God, which dwelleth
in heaven, prosper your journey, and the angel of God keep you company. So
they went forth both, and the young man’s dog with them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,17);</script>But Anna his mother
wept, and said to Tobit, Why hast thou sent away our son? is he not the
staff of our hand, in going in and out before us?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,18);</script>Be not greedy to add
money to money: but let it be as refuse in respect of our child.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,19);</script>For that which the
Lord hath given us to live with doth suffice us.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,20);</script>Then said Tobit to
her, Take no care, my sister; he shall return in safety, and thine eyes
shall see him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,21);</script>For the good angel
will keep him company, and his journey shall be prosperous, and he shall
return safe.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,22);</script>Then she made an end
of weeping.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,1);</script>And as they went on
their journey, they came in the evening to the river Tigris, and they
lodged there.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,2);</script>And when the young man
went down to wash himself, a fish leaped out of the river, and would have
devoured him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,3);</script>Then the angel said
unto him, Take the fish. And the young man laid hold of the fish, and drew
it to land.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,4);</script>To whom the angel said,
Open the fish, and take the heart and the liver and the gall, and put them
up safely.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,5);</script>So the young man did as
the angel commanded him; and when they had roasted the fish, they did eat
it: then they both went on their way, till they drew near to Ecbatane.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,6);</script>Then the young man said
to the angel, Brother Azarias, to what use is the heart and the liver and
the gal of the fish?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,7);</script>And he said unto him,
Touching the heart and the liver, if a devil or an evil spirit trouble
any, we must make a smoke thereof before the man or the woman, and the
party shall be no more vexed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,8);</script>As for the gall, it is
good to anoint a man that hath whiteness in his eyes, and he shall be
healed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,9);</script>And when they were come
near to Rages,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,10);</script>The angel said to the
young man, Brother, to day we shall lodge with Raguel, who is thy cousin;
he also hath one only daughter, named Sara; I will speak for her, that she
may be given thee for a wife.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,11);</script>For to thee doth the
right of her appertain, seeing thou only art of her kindred.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,12);</script>And the maid is fair
and wise: now therefore hear me, and I will speak to her father; and when
we return from Rages we will celebrate the marriage: for I know that
Raguel cannot marry her to another according to the law of Moses, but he
shall be guilty of death, because the right of inheritance doth rather
appertain to thee than to any other.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,13);</script>Then the young man
answered the angel, I have heard, brother Azarias that this maid hath been
given to seven men, who all died in the marriage chamber.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,14);</script>And now I am the only
son of my father, and I am afraid, lest if I go in unto her, I die, as the
other before: for a wicked spirit loveth her, which hurteth no body, but
those which come unto her; wherefore I also fear lest I die, and bring my
father’s and my mother’s life because of me to the grave with sorrow:
for they have no other son to bury them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,15);</script>Then the angel said
unto him, Dost thou not remember the precepts which thy father gave thee,
that thou shouldest marry a wife of thine own kindred? wherefore hear me,
O my brother; for she shall be given thee to wife; and make thou no
reckoning of the evil spirit; for this same night shall she be given thee
in marriage.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,16);</script>And when thou shalt
come into the marriage chamber, thou shalt take the ashes of perfume, and
shalt lay upon them some of the heart and liver of the fish, and shalt
make a smoke with it:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,17);</script>And the devil shall
smell it, and flee away, and never come again any more: but when thou
shalt come to her, rise up both of you, and pray to God which is merciful,
who will have pity on you, and save you: fear not, for she is appointed
unto thee from the beginning; and thou shalt preserve her, and she shall
go with thee. Moreover I suppose that she shall bear thee children. Now
when Tobias had heard these things, he loved her, and his heart was
effectually joined to her.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,1);</script>And when they were come
to Ecbatane, they came to the house of Raguel, and Sara met them: and
after they had saluted one another, she brought them into the house.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,2);</script>Then said Raguel to
Edna his wife, How like is this young man to Tobit my cousin!
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,3);</script>And Raguel asked them,
From whence are ye, brethren? To whom they said, We are of the sons of
Nephthalim, which are captives in Nineve.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,4);</script>Then he said to them,
Do ye know Tobit our kinsman? And they said, We know him. Then said he, Is
he in good health?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,5);</script>And they said, He is
both alive, and in good health: and Tobias said, He is my father.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,6);</script>Then Raguel leaped up,
and kissed him, and wept,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,7);</script>And blessed him, and
said unto him, Thou art the son of an honest and good man. But when he had
heard that Tobit was blind, he was sorrowful, and wept.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,8);</script>And likewise Edna his
wife and Sara his daughter wept. Moreover they entertained them
cheerfully; and after that they had killed a ram of the flock, they set
store of meat on the table. Then said Tobias to Raphael, Brother Azarias,
speak of those things of which thou didst talk in the way, and let this
business be dispatched.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,9);</script>So he communicated the
matter with Raguel: and Raguel said to Tobias, Eat and drink, and make
merry:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,10);</script>For it is meet that
thou shouldest marry my daughter: nevertheless I will declare unto thee
the truth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,11);</script>I have given my
daughter in marriage to seven men, who died that night they came in unto
her: nevertheless for the present be merry. But Tobias said, I will eat
nothing here, till we agree and swear one to another.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,12);</script>Raguel said, Then take
her from henceforth according to the manner, for thou art her cousin, and
she is thine, and the merciful God give you good success in all things.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,13);</script>Then he called his
daughter Sara, and she came to her father, and he took her by the hand,
and gave her to be wife to Tobias, saying, Behold, take her after the law
of Moses, and lead her away to thy father. And he blessed them;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,14);</script>And called Edna his
wife, and took paper, and did write an instrument of covenants, and sealed
it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,15);</script>Then they began to eat.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,16);</script>After Raguel called
his wife Edna, and said unto her, Sister, prepare another chamber, and
bring her in thither.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,17);</script>Which when she had
done as he had bidden her, she brought her thither: and she wept, and she
received the tears of her daughter, and said unto her,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,18);</script>Be of good comfort, my
daughter; the Lord of heaven and earth give thee joy for this thy sorrow:
be of good comfort, my daughter.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,1);</script>And when they had
supped, they brought Tobias in unto her.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,2);</script>And as he went, he
remembered the words of Raphael, and took the ashes of the perfumes, and
put the heart and the liver of the fish thereupon, and made a smoke
therewith.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,3);</script>The which smell when
the evil spirit had smelled, he fled into the utmost parts of Egypt, and
the angel bound him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,4);</script>And after that they
were both shut in together, Tobias rose out of the bed, and said, Sister,
arise, and let us pray that God would have pity on us.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,5);</script>Then began Tobias to
say, Blessed art thou, O God of our fathers, and blessed is thy holy and
glorious name for ever; let the heavens bless thee, and all thy creatures.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,6);</script>Thou madest Adam, and
gavest him Eve his wife for an helper and stay: of them came mankind: thou
hast said, It is not good that man should be alone; let us make unto him
an aid like unto himself.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,7);</script>And now, O Lord, I take
not this my sister for lust but uprightly: therefore mercifully ordain
that we may become aged together.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,8);</script>And she said with him,
Amen.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,9);</script>So they slept both that
night. And Raguel arose, and went and made a grave,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,10);</script>Saying, I fear lest he
also be dead.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,11);</script>But when Raguel was
come into his house,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,12);</script>He said unto his wife
Edna. Send one of the maids, and let her see whether he be alive: if he be
not, that we may bury him, and no man know it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,13);</script>So the maid opened the
door, and went in, and found them both asleep,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,14);</script>And came forth, and
told them that he was alive.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,15);</script>Then Raguel praised
God, and said, O God, thou art worthy to be praised with all pure and holy
praise; therefore let thy saints praise thee with all thy creatures; and
let all thine angels and thine elect praise thee for ever.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,16);</script>Thou art to be
praised, for thou hast made me joyful; and that is not come to me which I
suspected; but thou hast dealt with us according to thy great mercy.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,17);</script>Thou art to be praised
because thou hast had mercy of two that were the only begotten children of
their fathers: grant them mercy, O Lord, and finish their life in health
with joy and mercy.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,18);</script>Then Raguel bade his
servants to fill the grave.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,19);</script>And he kept the
wedding feast fourteen days.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,20);</script>For before the days of
the marriage were finished, Raguel had said unto him by an oath, that he
should not depart till the fourteen days of the marriage were expired;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,21);</script>And then he should
take the half of his goods, and go in safety to his father; and should
have the rest when I and my wife be dead.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,1);</script>Then Tobias called
Raphael, and said unto him,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,2);</script>Brother Azarias, take
with thee a servant, and two camels, and go to Rages of Media to Gabael,
and bring me the money, and bring him to the wedding.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,3);</script>For Raguel hath sworn
that I shall not depart.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,4);</script>But my father counteth
the days; and if I tarry long, he will be very sorry.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,5);</script>So Raphael went out,
and lodged with Gabael, and gave him the handwriting: who brought forth
bags which were sealed up, and gave them to him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,6);</script>And early in the
morning they went forth both together, and came to the wedding: and Tobias
blessed his wife.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,1);</script>Now Tobit his father
counted every day: and when the days of the journey were expired, and they
came not,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,2);</script>Then Tobit said, Are
they detained? or is Gabael dead, and there is no man to give him the
money?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,3);</script>Therefore he was very
sorry.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,4);</script>Then his wife said
unto him, My son is dead, seeing he stayeth long; and she began to wail
him, and said,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,5);</script>Now I care for
nothing, my son, since I have let thee go, the light of mine eyes.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,6);</script>To whom Tobit said,
Hold thy peace, take no care, for he is safe.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,7);</script>But she said, Hold thy
peace, and deceive me not; my son is dead. And she went out every day into
the way which they went, and did eat no meat on the daytime, and ceased
not whole nights to bewail her son Tobias, until the fourteen days of the
wedding were expired, which Raguel had sworn that he should spend there.
Then Tobias said to Raguel, Let me go, for my father and my mother look no
more to see me.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,8);</script>But his father in law
said unto him, Tarry with me, and I will send to thy father, and they
shall declare unto him how things go with thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,9);</script>But Tobias said, No;
but let me go to my father.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,10);</script>Then Raguel arose,
and gave him Sara his wife, and half his goods, servants, and cattle, and
money:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,11);</script>And he blessed them,
and sent them away, saying, The God of heaven give you a prosperous
journey, my children.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,12);</script>And he said to his
daughter, Honour thy father and thy mother in law, which are now thy
parents, that I may hear good report of thee. And he kissed her. Edna also
said to Tobias, The Lord of heaven restore thee, my dear brother, and
grant that I may see thy children of my daughter Sara before I die, that I
may rejoice before the Lord: behold, I commit my daughter unto thee of
special trust; where are do not entreat her evil.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,1);</script>After these things
Tobias went his way, praising God that he had given him a prosperous
journey, and blessed Raguel and Edna his wife, and went on his way till
they drew near unto Nineve.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,2);</script>Then Raphael said to
Tobias, Thou knowest, brother, how thou didst leave thy father:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,3);</script>Let us haste before
thy wife, and prepare the house.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,4);</script>And take in thine hand
the gall of the fish. So they went their way, and the dog went after them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,5);</script>Now Anna sat looking
about toward the way for her son.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,6);</script>And when she espied
him coming, she said to his father, Behold, thy son cometh, and the man
that went with him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,7);</script>Then said Raphael, I
know, Tobias, that thy father will open his eyes.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,8);</script>Therefore anoint thou
his eyes with the gall, and being pricked therewith, he shall rub, and the
whiteness shall fall away, and he shall see thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,9);</script>Then Anna ran forth,
and fell upon the neck of her son, and said unto him, Seeing I have seen
thee, my son, from henceforth I am content to die. And they wept both.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,10);</script>Tobit also went forth
toward the door, and stumbled: but his son ran unto him,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,11);</script>And took hold of his
father: and he strake of the gall on his fathers’ eyes, saying, Be of
good hope, my father.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,12);</script>And when his eyes
began to smart, he rubbed them;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,13);</script>And the whiteness
pilled away from the corners of his eyes: and when he saw his son, he fell
upon his neck.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,14);</script>And he wept, and
said, Blessed art thou, O God, and blessed is thy name for ever; and
blessed are all thine holy angels:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,15);</script>For thou hast
scourged, and hast taken pity on me: for, behold, I see my son Tobias. And
his son went in rejoicing, and told his father the great things that had
happened to him in Media.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,16);</script>Then Tobit went out
to meet his daughter in law at the gate of Nineve, rejoicing and praising
God: and they which saw him go marvelled, because he had received his
sight.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,17);</script>But Tobias gave
thanks before them, because God had mercy on him. And when he came near to
Sara his daughter in law, he blessed her, saying, Thou art welcome,
daughter: God be blessed, which hath brought thee unto us, and blessed be
thy father and thy mother. And there was joy among all his brethren which
were at Nineve.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,18);</script>And Achiacharus, and
Nasbas his brother’s son, came:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,19);</script>And Tobias’ wedding
was kept seven days with great joy.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,1);</script>Then Tobit called his
son Tobias, and said unto him, My son, see that the man have his wages,
which went with thee, and thou must give him more.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,2);</script>And Tobias said unto
him, O father, it is no harm to me to give him half of those things which
I have brought:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,3);</script>For he hath brought me
again to thee in safety, and made whole my wife, and brought me the money,
and likewise healed thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,4);</script>Then the old man said,
It is due unto him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,5);</script>So he called the
angel, and he said unto him, Take half of all that ye have brought and go
away in safety.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,6);</script>Then he took them both
apart, and said unto them, Bless God, praise him, and magnify him, and
praise him for the things which he hath done unto you in the sight of all
that live. It is good to praise God, and exalt his name, and honourably to
shew forth the works of God; therefore be not slack to praise him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,7);</script>It is good to keep
close the secret of a king, but it is honourable to reveal the works of
God. Do that which is good, and no evil shall touch you.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,8);</script>Prayer is good with
fasting and alms and righteousness. A little with righteousness is better
than much with unrighteousness. It is better to give alms than to lay up
gold:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,9);</script>For alms doth deliver
from death, and shall purge away all sin. Those that exercise alms and
righteousness shall be filled with life:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,10);</script>But they that sin are
enemies to their own life.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,11);</script>Surely I will keep
close nothing from you. For I said, It was good to keep close the secret
of a king, but that it was honourable to reveal the works of God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,12);</script>Now therefore, when
thou didst pray, and Sara thy daughter in law, I did bring the remembrance
of your prayers before the Holy One: and when thou didst bury the dead, I
was with thee likewise.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,13);</script>And when thou didst
not delay to rise up, and leave thy dinner, to go and cover the dead, thy
good deed was not hid from me: but I was with thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,14);</script>And now God hath sent
me to heal thee and Sara thy daughter in law.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,15);</script>I am Raphael, one of
the seven holy angels, which present the prayers of the saints, and which
go in and out before the glory of the Holy One.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,16);</script>Then they were both
troubled, and fell upon their faces: for they feared.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,17);</script>But he said unto
them, Fear not, for it shall go well with you; praise God therefore.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,18);</script>For not of any favour
of mine, but by the will of our God I came; wherefore praise him for ever.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,19);</script>All these days I did
appear unto you; but I did neither eat nor drink, but ye did see a vision.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,20);</script>Now therefore give
God thanks: for I go up to him that sent me; but write all things which
are done in a book.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,21);</script>And when they arose,
they saw him no more.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,22);</script>Then they confessed
the great and wonderful works of God, and how the angel of the Lord had
appeared unto them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,1);</script>Then Tobit wrote a
prayer of rejoicing, and said, Blessed be God that liveth for ever, and
blessed be his kingdom.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,2);</script>For he doth scourge,
and hath mercy: he leadeth down to hell, and bringeth up again: neither is
there any that can avoid his hand.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,3);</script>Confess him before the
Gentiles, ye children of Israel: for he hath scattered us among them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,4);</script>There declare his
greatness, and extol him before all the living: for he is our Lord, and he
is the God our Father for ever.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,5);</script>And he will scourge us
for our iniquities, and will have mercy again, and will gather us out of
all nations, among whom he hath scattered us.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,6);</script>If ye turn to him with
your whole heart, and with your whole mind, and deal uprightly before him,
then will he turn unto you, and will not hide his face from you. Therefore
see what he will do with you, and confess him with your whole mouth, and
praise the Lord of might, and extol the everlasting King. In the land of
my captivity do I praise him, and declare his might and majesty to a
sinful nation. O ye sinners, turn and do justice before him: who can tell
if he will accept you, and have mercy on you?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,7);</script>I will extol my God,
and my soul shall praise the King of heaven, and shall rejoice in his
greatness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,8);</script>Let all men speak, and
let all praise him for his righteousness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,9);</script>O Jerusalem, the holy
city, he will scourge thee for thy children’s works, and will have mercy
again on the sons of the righteous.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,10);</script>Give praise to the
Lord, for he is good: and praise the everlasting King, that his tabernacle
may be builded in thee again with joy, and let him make joyful there in
thee those that are captives, and love in thee for ever those that are
miserable.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,11);</script>Many nations shall
come from far to the name of the Lord God with gifts in their hands, even
gifts to the King of heaven; all generations shall praise thee with great
joy.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,12);</script>Cursed are all they
which hate thee, and blessed shall all be which love thee for ever.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,13);</script>Rejoice and be glad
for the children of the just: for they shall be gathered together, and
shall bless the Lord of the just.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,14);</script>O blessed are they
which love thee, for they shall rejoice in thy peace: blessed are they
which have been sorrowful for all thy scourges; for they shall rejoice for
thee, when they have seen all thy glory, and shall be glad for ever.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,15);</script>Let my soul bless God
the great King.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,16);</script>For Jerusalem shall
be built up with sapphires and emeralds, and precious stone: thy walls and
towers and battlements with pure gold.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,17);</script>And the streets of
Jerusalem shall be paved with beryl and carbuncle and stones of Ophir.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,18);</script>And all her streets
shall say, Alleluia; and they shall praise him, saying, Blessed be God,
which hath extolled it for ever.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,1);</script>So Tobit made an end
of praising God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,2);</script>And he was eight and
fifty years old when he lost his sight, which was restored to him after
eight years: and he gave alms, and he increased in the fear of the Lord
God, and praised him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,3);</script>And when he was very
aged he called his son, and the sons of his son, and said to him, My son,
take thy children; for, behold, I am aged, and am ready to depart out of
this life.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,4);</script>Go into Media my son,
for I surely believe those things which Jonas the prophet spake of Nineve,
that it shall be overthrown; and that for a time peace shall rather be in
Media; and that our brethren shall lie scattered in the earth from that
good land: and Jerusalem shall be desolate, and the house of God in it
shall be burned, and shall be desolate for a time;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,5);</script>And that again God
will have mercy on them, and bring them again into the land, where they
shall build a temple, but not like to the first, until the time of that
age be fulfilled; and afterward they shall return from all places of their
captivity, and build up Jerusalem gloriously, and the house of God shall
be built in it for ever with a glorious building, as the prophets have
spoken thereof.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,6);</script>And all nations shall
turn, and fear the Lord God truly, and shall bury their idols.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,7);</script>So shall all nations
praise the Lord, and his people shall confess God, and the Lord shall
exalt his people; and all those which love the Lord God in truth and
justice shall rejoice, shewing mercy to our brethren.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,8);</script>And now, my son,
depart out of Nineve, because that those things which the prophet Jonas
spake shall surely come to pass.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,9);</script>But keep thou the law
and the commandments, and shew thyself merciful and just, that it may go
well with thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,10);</script>And bury me decently,
and thy mother with me; but tarry no longer at Nineve. Remember, my son,
how Aman handled Achiacharus that brought him up, how out of light he
brought him into darkness, and how he rewarded him again: yet Achiacharus
was saved, but the other had his reward: for he went down into darkness.
Manasses gave alms, and escaped the snares of death which they had set for
him: but Aman fell into the snare, and perished.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,11);</script>Wherefore now, my
son, consider what alms doeth, and how righteousness doth deliver. When he
had said these things, he gave up the ghost in the bed, being an hundred
and eight and fifty years old; and he buried him honourably.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,12);</script>And when Anna his
mother was dead, he buried her with his father. But Tobias departed with
his wife and children to Ecbatane to Raguel his father in law,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,13);</script>Where he became old
with honour, and he buried his father and mother in law honourably, and he
inherited their substance, and his father Tobit’s.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,14);</script>And he died at
Ecbatane in Media, being an hundred and seven and twenty years old.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,15);</script>But before he died he
heard of the destruction of Nineve, which was taken by Nabuchodonosor and
Assuerus: and before his death he rejoiced over Nineve.
