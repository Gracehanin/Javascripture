The Book of Bel and the Dragon [in Daniel]
</h1><p>
The History of the Destruction of Bel and the Dragon, Cut off from the end
of Daniel.
<p>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,1);</script>And king Astyages was
gathered to his fathers, and Cyrus of Persia received his kingdom.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,2);</script>And Daniel conversed
with the king, and was honoured above all his friends.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,3);</script>Now the Babylons had an
idol, called Bel, and there were spent upon him every day twelve great
measures of fine flour, and forty sheep, and six vessels of wine.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,4);</script>And the king worshipped
it and went daily to adore it: but Daniel worshipped his own God. And the
king said unto him, Why dost not thou worship Bel?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,5);</script>Who answered and said,
Because I may not worship idols made with hands, but the living God, who
hath created the heaven and the earth, and hath sovereignty over all flesh.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,6);</script>Then said the king unto
him, Thinkest thou not that Bel is a living God? seest thou not how much
he eateth and drinketh every day?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,7);</script>Then Daniel smiled, and
said, O king, be not deceived: for this is but clay within, and brass
without, and did never eat or drink any thing.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,8);</script>So the king was wroth,
and called for his priests, and said unto them, If ye tell me not who this
is that devoureth these expences, ye shall die.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,9);</script>But if ye can certify
me that Bel devoureth them, then Daniel shall die: for he hath spoken
blasphemy against Bel. And Daniel said unto the king, Let it be according
to thy word.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,10);</script>Now the priests of Bel
were threescore and ten, beside their wives and children. And the king
went with Daniel into the temple of Bel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,11);</script>So Bel’s priests
said, Lo, we go out: but thou, O king, set on the meat, and make ready the
wine, and shut the door fast and seal it with thine own signet;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,12);</script>And to morrow when
thou comest in, if thou findest not that Bel hath eaten up all, we will
suffer death: or else Daniel, that speaketh falsely against us.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,13);</script>And they little
regarded it: for under the table they had made a privy entrance, whereby
they entered in continually, and consumed those things.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,14);</script>So when they were gone
forth, the king set meats before Bel. Now Daniel had commanded his
servants to bring ashes, and those they strewed throughout all the temple
in the presence of the king alone: then went they out, and shut the door,
and sealed it with the king’s signet, and so departed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,15);</script>Now in the night came
the priests with their wives and children, as they were wont to do, and
did eat and drink up all.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,16);</script>In the morning betime
the king arose, and Daniel with him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,17);</script>And the king said,
Daniel, are the seals whole? And he said, Yea, O king, they be whole.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,18);</script>And as soon as he had
opened the dour, the king looked upon the table, and cried with a loud
voice, Great art thou, O Bel, and with thee is no deceit at all.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,19);</script>Then laughed Daniel,
and held the king that he should not go in, and said, Behold now the
pavement, and mark well whose footsteps are these.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,20);</script>And the king said, I
see the footsteps of men, women, and children. And then the king was angry,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,21);</script>And took the priests
with their wives and children, who shewed him the privy doors, where they
came in, and consumed such things as were upon the table.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,22);</script>Therefore the king
slew them, and delivered Bel into Daniel’s power, who destroyed him and
his temple.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,23);</script>And in that same place
there was a great dragon, which they of Babylon worshipped.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,24);</script>And the king said unto
Daniel, Wilt thou also say that this is of brass? lo, he liveth, he eateth
and drinketh; thou canst not say that he is no living god: therefore
worship him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,25);</script>Then said Daniel unto
the king, I will worship the Lord my God: for he is the living God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,26);</script>But give me leave, O
king, and I shall slay this dragon without sword or staff. The king said,
I give thee leave.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,27);</script>Then Daniel took
pitch, and fat, and hair, and did seethe them together, and made lumps
thereof: this he put in the dragon’s mouth, and so the dragon burst in
sunder : and Daniel said, Lo, these are the gods ye worship.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,28);</script>When they of Babylon
heard that, they took great indignation, and conspired against the king,
saying, The king is become a Jew, and he hath destroyed Bel, he hath slain
the dragon, and put the priests to death.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,29);</script>So they came to the
king, and said, Deliver us Daniel, or else we will destroy thee and thine
house.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,30);</script>Now when the king saw
that they pressed him sore, being constrained, he delivered Daniel unto
them:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,31);</script>Who cast him into the
lions’ den: where he was six days.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,32);</script>And in the den there
were seven lions, and they had given them every day two carcases, and two
sheep: which then were not given to them, to the intent they might devour
Daniel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,33);</script>Now there was in Jewry
a prophet, called Habbacuc, who had made pottage, and had broken bread in
a bowl, and was going into the field, for to bring it to the reapers.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,34);</script>But the angel of the
Lord said unto Habbacuc, Go, carry the dinner that thou hast into Babylon
unto Daniel, who is in the lions’ den.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,35);</script>And Habbacuc said,
Lord, I never saw Babylon; neither do I know where the den is.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,36);</script>Then the angel of the
Lord took him by the crown, and bare him by the hair of his head, and
through the vehemency of his spirit set him in Babylon over the den.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,37);</script>And Habbacuc cried,
saying, O Daniel, Daniel, take the dinner which God hath sent thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,38);</script>And Daniel said, Thou
hast remembered me, O God: neither hast thou forsaken them that seek thee
and love thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,39);</script>So Daniel arose, and
did eat: and the angel of the Lord set Habbacuc in his own place again
immediately.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,40);</script>Upon the seventh day
the king went to bewail Daniel: and when he came to the den, he looked in,
and behold, Daniel was sitting.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,41);</script>Then cried the king
with a loud voice, saying, Great art Lord God of Daniel, and there is none
other beside thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,42);</script>And he drew him out,
and cast those that were the cause of his destruction into the den: and
they were devoured in a moment before his face.
