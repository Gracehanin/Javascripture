The Book of Baruch
</h1><p>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,1);</script>And these are the words of
the book, which Baruch the son of Nerias, the son of Maasias, the son of
Sedecias, the son of Asadias, the son of Chelcias, wrote in Babylon,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,2);</script>In the fifth year, and
in the seventh day of the month, what time as the Chaldeans took
Jerusalem, and burnt it with fire.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,3);</script>And Baruch did read the
words of this book in the hearing of Jechonias the son of Joachim king of
Juda, and in the ears of all the people that came to hear the book,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,4);</script>And in the hearing of
the nobles, and of the king’s sons, and in the hearing of the elders,
and of all the people, from the lowest unto the highest, even of all them
that dwelt at Babylon by the river Sud.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,5);</script>Whereupon they wept,
fasted, and prayed before the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,6);</script>They made also a
collection of money according to every man’s power:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,7);</script>And they sent it to
Jerusalem unto Joachim the high priest, the son of Chelcias, son of Salom,
and to the priests, and to all the people which were found with him at
Jerusalem,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,8);</script>At the same time when
he received the vessels of the house of the Lord, that were carried out of
the temple, to return them into the land of Juda, the tenth day of the
month Sivan, namely, silver vessels, which Sedecias the son of Josias king
of Jada had made,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,9);</script>After that
Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon had carried away Jechonias, and the
princes, and the captives, and the mighty men, and the people of the land,
from Jerusalem, and brought them unto Babylon.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,10);</script>And they said, Behold,
we have sent you money to buy you burnt offerings, and sin offerings, and
incense, and prepare ye manna, and offer upon the altar of the Lord our
God;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,11);</script>And pray for the life
of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and for the life of Balthasar his son,
that their days may be upon earth as the days of heaven:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,12);</script>And the Lord will give
us strength, and lighten our eyes, and we shall live under the shadow of
Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and under the shadow of Balthasar his son,
and we shall serve them many days, and find favour in their sight.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,13);</script>Pray for us also unto
the Lord our God, for we have sinned against the Lord our God; and unto
this day the fury of the Lord and his wrath is not turned from us.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,14);</script>And ye shall read this
book which we have sent unto you, to make confession in the house of the
Lord, upon the feasts and solemn days.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,15);</script>And ye shall say, To
the Lord our God belongeth righteousness, but unto us the confusion of
faces, as it is come to pass this day, unto them of Juda, and to the
inhabitants of Jerusalem,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,16);</script>And to our kings, and
to our princes, and to our priests, and to our prophets, and to our
fathers:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,17);</script>For we have sinned
before the Lord,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,18);</script>And disobeyed him, and
have not hearkened unto the voice of the Lord our God, to walk in the
commandments that he gave us openly:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,19);</script>Since the day that the
Lord brought our forefathers out of the land of Egypt, unto this present
day, we have been disobedient unto the Lord our God, and we have been
negligent in not hearing his voice.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,20);</script>Wherefore the evils
cleaved unto us, and the curse, which the Lord appointed by Moses his
servant at the time that he brought our fathers out of the land of Egypt,
to give us a land that floweth with milk and honey, like as it is to see
this day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,21);</script>Nevertheless we have
not hearkened unto the voice of the Lord our God, according unto all the
words of the prophets, whom he sent unto us:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,22);</script>But every man followed
the imagination of his own wicked heart, to serve strange gods, and to do
evil in the sight of the Lord our God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,1);</script>Therefore the Lord hath
made good his word, which he pronounced against us, and against our judges
that judged Israel, and against our kings, and against our princes, and
against the men of Israel and Juda,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,2);</script>To bring upon us great
plagues, such as never happened under the whole heaven, as it came to pass
in Jerusalem, according to the things that were written in the law of
Moses;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,3);</script>That a man should eat
the flesh of his own son, and the flesh of his own daughter.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,4);</script>Moreover he hath
delivered them to be in subjection to all the kingdoms that are round
about us, to be as a reproach and desolation among all the people round
about, where the Lord hath scattered them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,5);</script>Thus we were cast down,
and not exalted, because we have sinned against the Lord our God, and have
not been obedient unto his voice.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,6);</script>To the Lord our God
appertaineth righteousness: but unto us and to our fathers open shame, as
appeareth this day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,7);</script>For all these plagues
are come upon us, which the Lord hath pronounced against us
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,8);</script>Yet have we not prayed
before the Lord, that we might turn every one from the imaginations of his
wicked heart.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,9);</script>Wherefore the Lord
watched over us for evil, and the Lord hath brought it upon us: for the
Lord is righteous in all his works which he hath commanded us.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,10);</script>Yet we have not
hearkened unto his voice, to walk in the commandments of the Lord, that he
hath set before us.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,11);</script>And now, O Lord God of
Israel, that hast brought thy people out of the land of Egypt with a
mighty hand, and high arm, and with signs, and with wonders, and with
great power, and hast gotten thyself a name, as appeareth this day:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,12);</script>O Lord our God, we
have sinned, we have done ungodly, we have dealt unrighteously in all
thine ordinances.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,13);</script>Let thy wrath turn
from us: for we are but a few left among the heathen, where thou hast
scattered us.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,14);</script>Hear our prayers, O
Lord, and our petitions, and deliver us for thine own sake, and give us
favour in the sight of them which have led us away:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,15);</script>That all the earth may
know that thou art the Lord our God, because Israel and his posterity is
called by thy name.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,16);</script>O Lord, look down from
thine holy house, and consider us: bow down thine ear, O Lord, to hear us.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,17);</script>Open thine eyes, and
behold; for the dead that are in the graves, whose souls are taken from
their bodies, will give unto the Lord neither praise nor righteousness:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,18);</script>But the soul that is
greatly vexed, which goeth stooping and feeble, and the eyes that fail,
and the hungry soul, will give thee praise and righteousness, O Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,19);</script>Therefore we do not
make our humble supplication before thee, O Lord our God, for the
righteousness of our fathers, and of our kings.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,20);</script>For thou hast sent out
thy wrath and indignation upon us, as thou hast spoken by thy servants the
prophets, saying,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,21);</script>Thus saith the Lord,
Bow down your shoulders to serve the king of Babylon: so shall ye remain
in the land that I gave unto your fathers.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,22);</script>But if ye will not
hear the voice of the Lord, to serve the king of Babylon,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,23);</script>I will cause to cease
out of the cites of Judah, and from without Jerusalem, the voice of mirth,
and the voice of joy, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the
bride: and the whole land shall be desolate of inhabitants.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,24);</script>But we would not
hearken unto thy voice, to serve the king of Babylon: therefore hast thou
made good the words that thou spakest by thy servants the prophets,
namely, that the bones of our kings, and the bones of our fathers, should
be taken out of their place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,25);</script>And, lo, they are cast
out to the heat of the day, and to the frost of the night, and they died
in great miseries by famine, by sword, and by pestilence.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,26);</script>And the house which is
called by thy name hast thou laid waste, as it is to be seen this day, for
the wickedness of the house of Israel and the house of Juda.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,27);</script>O Lord our God, thou
hast dealt with us after all thy goodness, and according to all that great
mercy of thine,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,28);</script>As thou spakest by thy
servant Moses in the day when thou didst command him to write the law
before the children of Israel, saying,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,29);</script>If ye will not hear my
voice, surely this very great multitude shall be turned into a small
number among the nations, where I will scatter them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,30);</script>For I knew that they
would not hear me, because it is a stiffnecked people: but in the land of
their captivities they shall remember themselves.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,31);</script>And shall know that I
am the Lord their God: for I will give them an heart, and ears to hear:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,32);</script>And they shall praise
me in the land of their captivity, and think upon my name,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,33);</script>And return from their
stiff neck, and from their wicked deeds: for they shall remember the way
of their fathers, which sinned before the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,34);</script>And I will bring them
again into the land which I promised with an oath unto their fathers,
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and they shall be lords of it: and I will
increase them, and they shall not be diminished.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,35);</script>And I will make an
everlasting covenant with them to be their God, and they shall be my
people: and I will no more drive my people of Israel out of the land that
I have given them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,1);</script>O Lord Almighty, God of
Israel, the soul in anguish the troubled spirit, crieth unto thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,2);</script>Hear, O Lord, and have
mercy; ar thou art merciful: and have pity upon us, because we have sinned
before thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,3);</script>For thou endurest for
ever, and we perish utterly.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,4);</script>O Lord Almighty, thou
God of Israel, hear now the prayers of the dead Israelites, and of their
children, which have sinned before thee, and not hearkened unto the voice
of thee their God: for the which cause these plagues cleave unto us.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,5);</script>Remember not the
iniquities of our forefathers: but think upon thy power and thy name now
at this time.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,6);</script>For thou art the Lord
our God, and thee, O Lord, will we praise.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,7);</script>And for this cause thou
hast put thy fear in our hearts, to the intent that we should call upon
thy name, and praise thee in our captivity: for we have called to mind all
the iniquity of our forefathers, that sinned before thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,8);</script>Behold, we are yet this
day in our captivity, where thou hast scattered us, for a reproach and a
curse, and to be subject to payments, according to all the iniquities of
our fathers, which departed from the Lord our God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,9);</script>Hear, Israel, the
commandments of life: give ear to understand wisdom.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,10);</script>How happeneth it
Israel, that thou art in thine enemies’ land, that thou art waxen old in
a strange country, that thou art defiled with the dead,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,11);</script>That thou art counted
with them that go down into the grave?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,12);</script>Thou hast forsaken the
fountain of wisdom.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,13);</script>For if thou hadst
walked in the way of God, thou shouldest have dwelled in peace for ever.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,14);</script>Learn where is wisdom,
where is strength, where is understanding; that thou mayest know also
where is length of days, and life, where is the light of the eyes, and
peace.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,15);</script>Who hath found out her
place? or who hath come into her treasures ?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,16);</script>Where are the princes
of the heathen become, and such as ruled the beasts upon the earth;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,17);</script>They that had their
pastime with the fowls of the air, and they that hoarded up silver and
gold, wherein men trust, and made no end of their getting?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,18);</script>For they that wrought
in silver, and were so careful, and whose works are unsearchable,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,19);</script>They are vanished and
gone down to the grave, and others are come up in their steads.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,20);</script>Young men have seen
light, and dwelt upon the earth: but the way of knowledge have they not
known,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,21);</script>Nor understood the
paths thereof, nor laid hold of it: their children were far off from that
way.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,22);</script>It hath not been heard
of in Chanaan, neither hath it been seen in Theman.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,23);</script>The Agarenes that seek
wisdom upon earth, the merchants of Meran and of Theman, the authors of
fables, and searchers out of understanding; none of these have known the
way of wisdom, or remember her paths.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,24);</script>O Israel, how great is
the house of God! and how large is the place of his possession!
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,25);</script>Great, and hath none
end; high, and unmeasurable.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,26);</script>There were the giants
famous from the beginning, that were of so great stature, and so expert in
war.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,27);</script>Those did not the Lord
choose, neither gave he the way of knowledge unto them:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,28);</script>But they were
destroyed, because they had no wisdom, and perished through their own
foolishness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,29);</script>Who hath gone up into
heaven, and taken her, and brought her down from the clouds?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,30);</script>Who hath gone over the
sea, and found her, and will bring her for pure gold?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,31);</script>No man knoweth her
way, nor thinketh of her path.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,32);</script>But he that knoweth
all things knoweth her, and hath found her out with his understanding: he
that prepared the earth for evermore hath filled it with fourfooted beasts:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,33);</script>He that sendeth forth
light, and it goeth, calleth it again, and it obeyeth him with fear.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,34);</script>The stars shined in
their watches, and rejoiced: when he calleth them, they say, Here we be;
and so with cheerfulness they shewed light unto him that made them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,35);</script>This is our God, and
there shall none other be accounted of in comparison of him
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,36);</script>He hath found out all
the way of knowledge, and hath given it unto Jacob his servant, and to
Israel his beloved.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,37);</script>Afterward did he shew
himself upon earth, and conversed with men.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,1);</script>This is the book of the
commandments of God, and the law that endureth for ever: all they that
keep it shall come to life; but such as leave it shall die.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,2);</script>Turn thee, O Jacob, and
take hold of it: walk in the presence of the light thereof, that thou
mayest be illuminated.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,3);</script>Give not thine honour
to another, nor the things that are profitable unto thee to a strange
nation.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,4);</script>O Israel, happy are we:
for things that are pleasing to God are made known unto us.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,5);</script>Be of good cheer, my
people, the memorial of Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,6);</script>Ye were sold to the
nations, not for <I>your</I> destruction: but because ye moved God to
wrath, ye were delivered unto the enemies.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,7);</script>For ye provoked him
that made you by sacrificing unto devils, and not to God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,8);</script>Ye have forgotten the
everlasting God, that brought you up; and ye have grieved Jerusalem, that
nursed you.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,9);</script>For when she saw the
wrath of God coming upon you, she said, Hearken, O ye that dwell about
Sion: God hath brought upon me great mourning;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,10);</script>For I saw the
captivity of my sons and daughters, which the Everlasting brought upon
them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,11);</script>With joy did I nourish
them; but sent them away with weeping and mourning.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,12);</script>Let no man rejoice
over me, a widow, and forsaken of many, who for the sins of my children am
left desolate; because they departed from the law of God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,13);</script>They knew not his
statutes, nor walked in the ways of his commandments, nor trod in the
paths of discipline in his righteousness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,14);</script>Let them that dwell
about Sion come, and remember ye the captivity of my sons and daughters,
which the Everlasting hath brought upon them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,15);</script>For he hath brought a
nation upon them from far, a shameless nation, and of a strange language,
who neither reverenced old man, nor pitied child.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,16);</script>These have carried
away the dear beloved children of the widow, and left her that was alone
desolate without daughters.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,17);</script>But what can I help
you?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,18);</script>For he that brought
these plagues upon you will deliver you from the hands of your enemies.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,19);</script>Go your way, O my
children, go your way: for I am left desolate.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,20);</script>I have put off the
clothing of peace, and put upon me the sackcloth of my prayer: I will cry
unto the Everlasting in my days.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,21);</script>Be of good cheer, O my
children, cry unto the Lord, and he will deliver you from the power and
hand of the enemies.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,22);</script>For my hope is in the
Everlasting, that he will save you; and joy is come unto me from the Holy
One, because of the mercy which shall soon come unto you from the
Everlasting our Saviour.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,23);</script>For I sent you out
with mourning and weeping: but God will give you to me again with joy and
gladness for ever.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,24);</script>Like as now the
neighbours of Sion have seen your captivity: so shall they see shortly
your salvation from our God which shall come upon you with great glory,
and brightness of the Everlasting.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,25);</script>My children, suffer
patiently the wrath that is come upon you from God: for thine enemy hath
persecuted thee; but shortly thou shalt see his destruction, and shalt
tread upon his neck.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,26);</script>My delicate ones have
gone rough ways, and were taken away as a flock caught of the enemies.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,27);</script>Be of good comfort, O
my children, and cry unto God: for ye shall be remembered of him that
brought these things upon you.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,28);</script>For as it was your
mind to go astray from God: so, being returned, seek him ten times more.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,29);</script>For he that hath
brought these plagues upon you shall bring you everlasting joy with your
salvation.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,30);</script>Take a good heart, O
Jerusalem: for he that gave thee that name will comfort thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,31);</script>Miserable are they
that afflicted thee, and rejoiced at thy fall.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,32);</script>Miserable are the
cities which thy children served: miserable is she that received thy sons.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,33);</script>For as she rejoiced at
thy ruin, and was glad of thy fall: so shall she be grieved for her own
desolation.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,34);</script>For I will take away
the rejoicing of her great multitude, and her pride shall be turned into
mourning.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,35);</script>For fire shall come
upon her from the Everlasting, long to endure; and she shall be inhabited
of devils for a great time.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,36);</script>O Jerusalem, look
about thee toward the east, and behold the joy that cometh unto thee from
God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,37);</script>Lo, thy sons come,
whom thou sentest away, they come gathered together from the east to the
west by the word of the Holy One, rejoicing in the glory of God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,1);</script>Put off, O Jerusalem,
the garment of mourning and affliction, and put on the comeliness of the
glory that cometh from God for ever.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,2);</script>Cast about thee a
double garment of the righteousness which cometh from God; and set a
diadem on thine head of the glory of the Everlasting.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,3);</script>For God will shew thy
brightness unto every country under heaven.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,4);</script>For thy name shall be
called of God for ever The peace of righteousness, and The glory of
God’s worship.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,5);</script>Arise, O Jerusalem, and
stand on high, and look about toward the east, and behold thy children
gathered from the west unto the east by the word of the Holy One,
rejoicing in the remembrance of God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,6);</script>For they departed from
thee on foot, and were led away of their enemies: but God bringeth them
unto thee exalted with glory, as children of the kingdom.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,7);</script>For God hath appointed
that every high hill, and banks of long continuance, should be cast down,
and valleys filled up, to make even the ground, that Israel may go safely
in the glory of God,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,8);</script>Moreover even the woods
and every sweetsmelling tree shall overshadow Israel by the commandment of
God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,9);</script>For God shall lead
Israel with joy in the light of his glory with the mercy and righteousness
that cometh from him.
