The First Book of Esdras
</h1><p>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,1);</script>And Josias held the feast
of the passover in Jerusalem unto his Lord, and offered the passover the
fourteenth day of the first month;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,2);</script>Having set the priests
according to their daily courses, being arrayed in long garments, in the
temple of the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,3);</script>And he spake unto the
Levites, the holy ministers of Israel, that they should hallow themselves
unto the Lord, to set the holy ark of the Lord in the house that king
Solomon the son of David had built:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,4);</script>And said, Ye shall no
more bear the ark upon your shoulders: now therefore serve the Lord your
God, and minister unto his people Israel, and prepare you after your
families and kindreds,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,5);</script>According as David the
king of Israel prescribed, and according to the magnificence of Solomon
his son: and standing in the temple according to the several dignity of
the families of you the Levites, who minister in the presence of your
brethren the children of Israel,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,6);</script>Offer the passover in
order, and make ready the sacrifices for your brethren, and keep the
passover according to the commandment of the Lord, which was given unto
Moses.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,7);</script>And unto the people
that was found there Josias gave thirty thousand lambs and kids, and three
thousand calves: these things were given of the king’s allowance,
according as he promised, to the people, to the priests, and to the
Levites.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,8);</script>And Helkias, Zacharias,
and Syelus, the governors of the temple, gave to the priests for the
passover two thousand and six hundred sheep, and three hundred calves.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,9);</script>And Jeconias, and
Samaias, and Nathanael his brother, and Assabias, and Ochiel, and Joram,
captains over thousands, gave to the Levites for the passover five
thousand sheep, and seven hundred calves.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,10);</script>And when these things
were done, the priests and Levites, having the unleavened bread, stood in
very comely order according to the kindreds,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,11);</script>And according to the
several dignities of the fathers, before the people, to offer to the Lord,
as it is written in the book of Moses: and thus did they in the morning.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,12);</script>And they roasted the
passover with fire, as appertaineth: as for the sacrifices, they sod them
in brass pots and pans with a good savour,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,13);</script>And set them before
all the people: and afterward they prepared for themselves, and for the
priests their brethren, the sons of Aaron.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,14);</script>For the priests
offered the fat until night: and the Levites prepared for themselves, and
the priests their brethren, the sons of Aaron.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,15);</script>The holy singers also,
the sons of Asaph, were in their order, according to the appointment of
David, to wit, Asaph, Zacharias, and Jeduthun, who was of the king’s
retinue.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,16);</script>Moreover the porters
were at every gate; it was not lawful for any to go from his ordinary
service: for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,17);</script>Thus were the things
that belonged to the sacrifices of the Lord accomplished in that day, that
they might hold  the passover,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,18);</script>And offer sacrifices
upon the altar of the Lord, according to the commandment of king Josias.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,19);</script>So the children of
Israel which were present held the passover at that time, and the feast of
sweet bread seven days.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,20);</script>And such a passover
was not kept in Israel since the time of the prophet Samuel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,21);</script>Yea, all the kings of
Israel held not such a passover as Josias, and the priests, and the
Levites, and the Jews, held with all Israel that were found dwelling at
Jerusalem.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,22);</script>In the eighteenth year
of the reign of Josias was this passover kept.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,23);</script>And the works or
Josias were upright before his Lord with an heart full of godliness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,24);</script>As for the things that
came to pass in his time, they were written in former times, concerning
those that sinned, and did wickedly against the Lord above all people and
kingdoms, and how they grieved him exceedingly, so that the words of the
Lord rose up against Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,25);</script>Now after all these
acts of Josias it came to pass, that Pharaoh the king of Egypt came to
raise war at Carchamis upon Euphrates: and Josias went out against him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,26);</script>But the king of Egypt
sent to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, O king of Judea?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,27);</script>I am not sent out from
the Lord God against thee; for my war is upon Euphrates: and now the Lord
is with me, yea, the Lord is with me hasting me forward: depart from me,
and be not against the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,28);</script>Howbeit Josias did not
turn back his chariot from him, but undertook to fight with him, not
regarding the words of the prophet Jeremy spoken by the mouth of the Lord:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,29);</script>But joined battle with
him in the plain of Magiddo, and the princes came against king Josias.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,30);</script>Then said the king
unto his servants, Carry me away out of the battle; for I am very weak.
And immediately his servants took him away out of the battle.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,31);</script>Then gat he up upon
his second chariot; and being brought back to Jerusalem died, and was
buried in his father’s sepulchre.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,32);</script>And in all Jewry they
mourned for Josias, yea, Jeremy the prophet lamented for Josias, and the
chief men with the women made lamentation for him unto this day: and this
was given out for an ordinance to be done continually in all the nation of
Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,33);</script>These things are
written in the book of the stories of the kings of Judah, and every one of
the acts that Josias did, and his glory, and his understanding in the law
of the Lord, and the things that he had done before, and the things now
recited, are reported in the book of the kings of Israel and Judea.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,34);</script>And the people took
Joachaz the son of Josias, and made him king instead of Josias his father,
when he was twenty and three years old.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,35);</script>And he reigned in
Judea and in Jerusalem three months: and then the king of Egypt deposed
him from reigning in Jerusalem.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,36);</script>And he set a tax upon
the land of an hundred talents of silver and one talent of gold.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,37);</script>The king of Egypt also
made king Joacim his brother king of Judea and Jerusalem.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,38);</script>And he bound Joacim
and the nobles: but Zaraces his brother he apprehended, and brought him
out of Egypt.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,39);</script>Five and twenty years
old was Joacim when he was made king in the land of Judea and Jerusalem;
and he did evil before the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,40);</script>Wherefore against him
Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon came up, and bound him with a chain of
brass, and carried him into Babylon.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,41);</script>Nabuchodonosor also
took of the holy vessels of the Lord, and carried them away, and set them
in his own temple at Babylon.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,42);</script>But those things that
are recorded of him, and of his uncleaness and impiety, are written in the
chronicles of the kings.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,43);</script>And Joacim his son
reigned in his stead: he was made king being eighteen years old;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,44);</script>And reigned but three
months and ten days in Jerusalem; and did evil before the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,45);</script>So after a year
Nabuchodonosor sent and caused him to be brought into Babylon with the
holy vessels of the Lord;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,46);</script>And made Zedechias
king of Judea and Jerusalem, when he was one and twenty years old; and he
reigned eleven years:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,47);</script>And he did evil also
in the sight of the Lord, and cared not for the words that were spoken
unto him by the prophet Jeremy from the mouth of the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,48);</script>And after that king
Nabuchodonosor had made him to swear by the name of the Lord, he forswore
himself, and rebelled; and hardening his neck, his heart, he transgressed
the laws of the Lord God of Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,49);</script>The governors also of
the people and of the priests did many things against the laws, and passed
all the pollutions of all nations, and defiled the temple of the Lord,
which was sanctified in Jerusalem.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,50);</script>Nevertheless the God
of their fathers sent by his messenger to call them back, because he
spared them and his tabernacle also.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,51);</script>But they had his
messengers in derision; and, look, when the Lord spake unto them, they
made a sport of his prophets:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,52);</script>So far forth, that he,
being wroth with his people for their great ungodliness, commanded the
kings of the Chaldees to come up against them;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,53);</script>Who slew their young
men with the sword, yea, even within the compass of their holy temple, and
spared neither young man nor maid, old man nor child, among them; for he
delivered all into their hands.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,54);</script>And they took all the
holy vessels of the Lord, both great and small, with the vessels of the
ark of God, and the king’s treasures, and carried them away into Babylon.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,55);</script>As for the house of
the Lord, they burnt it, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem, and set
fire upon her towers:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,56);</script>And as for her
glorious things, they never ceased till they had consumed and brought them
all to nought: and the people that were not slain with the sword he
carried unto Babylon:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,57);</script>Who became servants to
him and his children, till the Persians reigned, to fulfil the word of the
Lord spoken by the mouth of Jeremy:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,58);</script>Until the land had
enjoyed her sabbaths, the whole time of her desolation shall she rest,
until the full term of seventy years.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,1);</script>In the first year of
Cyrus king of the Persians, that the word of the Lord might be
accomplished, that he had promised by the mouth of Jeremy;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,2);</script>The Lord raised up the
spirit of Cyrus the king of the Persians, and he made proclamation through
all his kingdom, and also by writing,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,3);</script>Saying, Thus saith
Cyrus king of the Persians; The Lord of Israel, the most high Lord, hath
made me king of the whole world,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,4);</script>And commanded me to
build him an house at Jerusalem in Jewry.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,5);</script>If therefore there be
any of you that are of his people, let the Lord, even his Lord, be with
him, and let him go up to Jerusalem that is in Judea, and build the house
of the Lord of Israel: for he is the Lord that dwelleth in Jerusalem.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,6);</script>Whosoever then dwell in
the places about, let them help him, those, I say, that are his
neighbours, with gold, and with silver,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,7);</script>With gifts, with
horses, and with cattle, and other things, which have been set forth by
vow, for the temple of the Lord at Jerusalem.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,8);</script>Then the chief of the
families of Judea and of the tribe of Benjamin stood up; the priests also,
and the Levites, and all they whose mind the Lord had moved to go up, and
to build an house for the Lord at Jerusalem,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,9);</script>And they that dwelt
round about them, and helped them in all things with silver and gold, with
horses and cattle, and with very many free gifts of a great number whose
minds were stirred up thereto.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,10);</script>King Cyrus also
brought forth the holy vessels, which Nabuchodonosor had carried away from
Jerusalem, and had set up in his temple of idols.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,11);</script>Now when Cyrus king of
the Persians had brought them forth, he delivered them to Mithridates his
treasurer:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,12);</script>And by him they were
delivered to Sanabassar the governor of Judea.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,13);</script>And this was the
number of them; A thousand golden cups, and a thousand of silver, censers
of silver twenty nine, vials of gold thirty, and of silver two thousand
four hundred and ten, and a thousand other vessels.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,14);</script>So all the vessels of
gold and of silver, which were carried away, were five thousand four
hundred threescore and nine.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,15);</script>These were brought
back by Sanabassar, together with them of the captivity, from Babylon to
Jerusalem.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,16);</script>But in the time of
Artexerxes king of the Persians Belemus, and Mithridates, and Tabellius,
and Rathumus, and Beeltethmus, and Semellius the secretary, with others
that were in commission with them, dwelling in Samaria and other places,
wrote unto him against them that dwelt in Judea and Jerusalem these
letters following;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,17);</script>To king Artexerxes our
lord, Thy servants, Rathumus the storywriter, and Semellius the scribe,
and the rest of their council, and the judges that are in Celosyria and
Phenice.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,18);</script>Be it now known to the
lord king, that the Jews that are up from you to us, being come into
Jerusalem, that rebellious and wicked city, do build the marketplaces, and
repair the walls of it and do lay the foundation of the temple.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,19);</script>Now if this city and
the walls thereof be made up again, they will not only refuse to give
tribute, but also rebel against kings.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,20);</script>And forasmuch as the
things pertaining to the temple are now in hand, we think it meet not to
neglect such a matter,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,21);</script>But to speak unto our
lord the king, to the intent that, if it be thy pleasure it may be sought
out in the books of thy fathers:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,22);</script>And thou shalt find in
the chronicles what is written concerning these things, and shalt
understand that that city was rebellious, troubling both kings and cities:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,23);</script>And that the Jews were
rebellious, and raised always wars therein; for the which cause even this
city was made desolate.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,24);</script>Wherefore now we do
declare unto thee, O lord the king, that if this city be built again, and
the walls thereof set up anew, thou shalt from henceforth have no passage
into Celosyria and Phenice.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,25);</script>Then the king wrote
back again to Rathumus the storywriter, to Beeltethmus, to Semellius the
scribe, and to the rest that were in commission, and dwellers in Samaria
and Syria and Phenice, after this manner;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,26);</script>I have read the
epistle which ye have sent unto me: therefore I commanded to make diligent
search, and it hath been found that that city was from the beginning
practising against kings;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,27);</script>And the men therein
were given to rebellion and war: and that mighty kings and fierce were in
Jerusalem, who reigned and exacted tributes in Celosyria and Phenice.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,28);</script>Now therefore I have
commanded to hinder those men from building the city, and heed to be taken
that there be no more done in it;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,29);</script>And that those wicked
workers proceed no further to the annoyance of kings,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,30);</script>Then king Artexerxes
his letters being read, Rathumus, and Semellius the scribe, and the rest
that were in commission with them, removing in haste toward Jerusalem with
a troop of horsemen and a multitude of people in battle array, began to
hinder the builders; and the building of the temple in Jerusalem ceased
until the second year of the reign of Darius king of the Persians.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,1);</script>Now when Darius
reigned, he made a great feast unto all his subjects, and unto all his
household, and unto all the princes of Media and Persia,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,2);</script>And to all the
governors and captains and lieutenants that were under him, from India
unto Ethiopia, of an hundred twenty and seven provinces.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,3);</script>And when they had eaten
and drunken, and being satisfied were gone home, then Darius the king went
into his bedchamber, and slept, and soon after awaked.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,4);</script>Then three young men,
that were of the guard that kept the king’s body, spake one to another;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,5);</script>Let every one of us
speak a sentence: he that shall overcome, and whose sentence shall seem
wiser than the others, unto him shall the king Darius give great gifts,
and great things in token of victory:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,6);</script>As, to be clothed in
purple, to drink in gold, and to sleep upon gold, and a chariot with
bridles of gold, and an headtire of fine linen, and a chain about his neck:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,7);</script>And he shall sit next
to Darius because of his wisdom, and shall be called Darius his cousin.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,8);</script>And then every one
wrote his sentence, sealed it, and laid it under king Darius his pillow;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,9);</script>And said that, when the
king is risen, some will give him the writings; and of whose side the king
and the three princes of Persia shall judge that his sentence is the
wisest, to him shall the victory be given, as was appointed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,10);</script>The first wrote, Wine
is the strongest.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,11);</script>The second wrote, The
king is strongest.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,12);</script>The third wrote, Women
are strongest: but above all things Truth beareth away the victory.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,13);</script>Now when the king was
risen up, they took their writings, and delivered them unto him, and so he
read them:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,14);</script>And sending forth he
called all the princes of Persia and Media, and the governors, and the
captains, and the lieutenants, and the chief officers;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,15);</script>And sat him down in
the royal seat of judgment; and the writings were read before them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,16);</script>And he said, Call the
young men, and they shall declare their own sentences. So they were
called, and came in.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,17);</script>And he said unto them,
Declare unto us your mind concerning the writings. Then began the first,
who had spoken of the strength of wine;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,18);</script>And he said thus, O ye
men, how exceeding strong is wine! it causeth all men to err that drink it:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,19);</script>It maketh the mind of
the king and of the fatherless child to be all one; of the bondman and of
the freeman, of the poor man and of the rich:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,20);</script>It turneth also every
thought into jollity and mirth, so that a man remembereth neither sorrow
nor debt:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,21);</script>And it maketh every
heart rich, so that a man remembereth neither king nor governor; and it
maketh to speak all things by talents:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,22);</script>And when they are in
their cups, they forget their love both to friends and brethren, and a
little after draw out swords:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,23);</script>But when they are from
the wine, they remember not what they have done.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,24);</script>O ye men, is not wine
the strongest, that enforceth to do thus? And when he had so spoken, he
held his peace.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,1);</script>Then the second, that
had spoken of the strength of the king, began to say,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,2);</script>O ye men, do not men
excel in strength that bear rule over sea and land and all things in them?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,3);</script>But yet the king is
more mighty: for he is lord of all these things, and hath dominion over
them; and whatsoever he commandeth them they do.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,4);</script>If he bid them make war
the one against the other, they do it: if he send them out against the
enemies, they go, and break down mountains walls and towers.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,5);</script>They slay and are
slain, and transgress not the king’s commandment: if they get the
victory, they bring all to the king, as well the spoil, as all things else.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,6);</script>Likewise for those that
are no soldiers, and have not to do with wars, but use husbundry, when
they have reaped again that which they had sown, they bring it to the
king, and compel one another to pay tribute unto the king.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,7);</script>And yet he is but one
man: if he command to kill, they kill; if he command to spare, they spare;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,8);</script>If he command to smite,
they smite; if he command to make desolate, they make desolate; if he
command to build, they build;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,9);</script>If he command to cut
down, they cut down; if he command to plant, they plant.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,10);</script>So all his people and
his armies obey him: furthermore he lieth down, he eateth and drinketh,
and taketh his rest:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,11);</script>And these keep watch
round about him, neither may any one depart, and do his own business,
neither disobey they him in any thing.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,12);</script>O ye men, how should
not the king be mightiest, when in such sort he is obeyed? And he held his
tongue.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,13);</script>Then the third, who
had spoken of women, and of the truth, (this was Zorobabel) began to speak.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,14);</script>O ye men, it is not
the great king, nor the multitude of men, neither is it wine, that
excelleth; who is it then that ruleth them, or hath the lordship over
them? are they not women?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,15);</script>Women have borne the
king and all the people that bear rule by sea and land.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,16);</script>Even of them came
they: and they nourished them up that planted the vineyards, from whence
the wine cometh.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,17);</script>These also make
garments for men; these bring glory unto men; and without women cannot men
be.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,18);</script>Yea, and if men have
gathered together gold and silver, or any other goodly thing, do they not
love a woman which is comely in favour and beauty?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,19);</script>And letting all those
things go, do they not gape, and even with open mouth fix their eyes fast
on her; and have not all men more desire unto her than unto silver or
gold, or any goodly thing whatsoever?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,20);</script>A man leaveth his own
father that brought him up, and his own country, and cleaveth unto his
wife.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,21);</script>He sticketh not to
spend his life with his wife. and remembereth neither father, nor mother,
nor country.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,22);</script>By this also ye must
know that women have dominion over you: do ye not labour and toil, and
give and bring all to the woman?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,23);</script>Yea, a man taketh his
sword, and goeth his way to rob and to steal, to sail upon the sea and
upon rivers;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,24);</script>And looketh upon a
lion, and goeth in the darkness; and when he hath stolen, spoiled, and
robbed, he bringeth it to his love.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,25);</script>Wherefore a man loveth
his wife better than father or mother.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,26);</script>Yea, many there be
that have run out of their wits for women, and become servants for their
sakes.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,27);</script>Many also have
perished, have erred, and sinned, for women.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,28);</script>And now do ye not
believe me? is not the king great in his power? do not all regions fear to
touch him?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,29);</script>Yet did I see him and
Apame the king’s concubine, the daughter of the admirable Bartacus,
sitting at the right hand of the king,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,30);</script>And taking the crown
from the king’s head, and setting it upon her own head; she also struck
the king with her left hand.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,31);</script>And yet for all this
the king gaped and gazed upon her with open mouth: if she laughed upon
him, he laughed also: but if she took any displeasure at him, the king was
fain to flatter, that she might be reconciled to him again.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,32);</script>O ye men, how can it
be but women should be strong, seeing they do thus?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,33);</script>Then the king and the
princes looked one upon another: so he began to speak of the truth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,34);</script>O ye men, are not
women strong? great is the earth, high is the heaven, swift is the sun in
his course, for he compasseth the heavens round about, and fetcheth his
course again to his own place in one day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,35);</script>Is he not great that
maketh these things? therefore great is the truth, and stronger than all
things.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,36);</script>All the earth crieth
upon the truth, and the heaven blesseth it: all works shake and tremble at
it, and with it is no unrighteous thing.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,37);</script>Wine is wicked, the
king is wicked, women are wicked, all the children of men are wicked, and
such are all their wicked works; and there is no truth in them; in their
unrighteousness also they shall perish.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,38);</script>As for the truth, it
endureth, and is alwaYs strong; it liveth and conquereth for evermore.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,39);</script>With her there is no
accepting of persons or rewards; but she doeth the things that are just,
and refraineth from all unjust and wicked things; and all men do well like
of her works.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,40);</script>Neither in her
judgment is any unrighteousness; and she is the strength, kingdom, power,
and majesty, of all ages. Blessed be the God of truth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,41);</script>And with that he held
his peace. And all the people then shouted, and said, Great is Truth, and
mighty above all things.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,42);</script>Then said the king
unto him, Ask what thou wilt more than is appointed in the writing, and we
will give it thee, because thou art found wisest; and thou shalt sit next
me, and shalt be called my cousin.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,43);</script>Then said he unto the
king, Remember thy vow, which thou hast vowed to build Jerusalem, in the
day when thou camest to thy kingdom,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,44);</script>And to send away all
the vessels that were taken away out of Jerusalem, which Cyrus set apart,
when he vowed to destroy Babylon, and to send them again thither.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,45);</script>Thou also hast vowed
to build up the temple, which the Edomites burned when Judea was made
desolate by the Chaldees.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,46);</script>And now, O lord the
king, this is that which I require, and which I desire of thee, and this
is the princely liberality proceeding from thyself: I desire therefore
that thou make good the vow, the performance whereof with thine own mouth
thou hast vowed to the King of heaven.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,47);</script>Then Darius the king
stood up, and kissed him, and wrote letters for him unto all the
treasurers and lieutenants and captains and governors, that they should
safely convey on their way both him, and all those that go up with him to
build Jerusalem.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,48);</script>He wrote letters also
unto the lieutenants that were in Celosyria and Phenice, and unto them in
Libanus, that they should bring cedar wood from Libanus unto Jerusalem,
and that they should build the city with him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,49);</script>Moreover he wrote for
all the Jews that went out of his realm up into Jewry, concerning their
freedom, that no officer, no ruler, no lieutenant, nor treasurer, should
forcibly enter into their doors;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,50);</script>And that all the
country which they hold should be free without tribute; and that the
Edomites should give over the villages of the Jews which then they held:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,51);</script>Yea, that there should
be yearly given twenty talents to the building of the temple, until the
time that it were built;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,52);</script>And other ten talents
yearly, to maintain the burnt offerings upon the altar every day, as they
had a commandment to offer seventeen:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,53);</script>And that all they that
went from Babylon to build the city should have free liberty, as well they
as their posterity, and all the priests that went away.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,54);</script>He wrote also
concerning. the charges, and the priests’ vestments wherein they
minister;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,55);</script>And likewise for the
charges of the Levites, to be given them until the day that the house were
finished, and Jerusalem builded up.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,56);</script>And he commanded to
give to all that kept the city pensions and wages.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,57);</script>He sent away also all
the vessels from Babylon, that Cyrus had set apart; and all that Cyrus had
given in commandment, the same charged he also to be done, and sent unto
Jerusalem.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,58);</script>Now when this young
man was gone forth, he lifted up his face to heaven toward Jerusalem, and
praised the King of heaven,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,59);</script>And said, From thee
cometh victory, from thee cometh wisdom, and thine is the glory, and I am
thy servant.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,60);</script>Blessed art thou, who
hast given me wisdom: for to thee I give thanks, O Lord of our fathers.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,61);</script>And so he took the
letters, and went out, and came unto Babylon, and told it all his brethren.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,62);</script>And they praised the
God of their fathers, because he had given them freedom and liberty
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,63);</script>To go up, and to build
Jerusalem, and the temple which is called by his name: and they feasted
with instruments of musick and gladness seven days.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,1);</script>After this were the
principal men of the families chosen according to their tribes, to go up
with their wives and sons and daughters, with their menservants and
maidservants, and their cattle.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,2);</script>And Darius sent with
them a thousand horsemen, till they had brought them back to Jerusalem
safely, and with musical <I>instruments</I> tabrets and flutes.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,3);</script>And all their brethren
played, and he made them go up together with them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,4);</script>And these are the names
of the men which went up, according to their families among their tribes,
after their several heads.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,5);</script>The priests, the sons
of Phinees the son of Aaron: Jesus the son of Josedec, the son of Saraias,
and Joacim the son of Zorobabel, the son of Salathiel, of the house of
David, out of the kindred of Phares, of the tribe of Judah;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,6);</script>Who spake wise
sentences before Darius the king of Persia in the second year of his
reign, in the month Nisan, which is the first month.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,7);</script>And these are they of
Jewry that came up from the captivity, where they dwelt as strangers, whom
Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon had carried away unto Babylon.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,8);</script>And they returned unto
Jerusalem, and to the other parts of Jewry, every man to his own city, who
came with Zorobabel, with Jesus, Nehemias, and Zacharias, and Reesaias,
Enenius, Mardocheus. Beelsarus, Aspharasus, Reelius, Roimus, and Baana,
their guides.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,9);</script>The number of them of

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,35);</script>All the ministers of
the temple, and the sons of the servants of Solomon, were three hundred
seventy and two.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,36);</script>These came up from
Thermeleth and Thelersas, Charaathalar leading them, and Aalar;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,37);</script>Neither could they
shew their families, nor their stock, how they were of Israel: the sons of
Ladan, the son of Ban, the sons of Necodan, six hundred fifty and two.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,38);</script>And of the priests
that usurped the office of the priesthood, and were not found: the sons of
Obdia, the sons of Accoz, the sons of Addus, who married Augia one of the
daughters of Barzelus, and was named after his name.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,39);</script>And when the
description of the kindred of these men was sought in the register, and
was not found, they were removed from executing the office of the
priesthood:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,40);</script>For unto them said
Nehemias and Atharias, that they should not be partakers of the holy
things, till there arose up an high priest clothed with doctrine and truth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,41);</script>So of Israel, from
them of twelve years old and upward, they were all in number forty
thousand, beside menservants and womenservants two thousand three hundred
and sixty.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,42);</script>Their menservants and
handmaids were seven thousand three hundred forty and seven: the singing
men and singing women, two hundred forty and five:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,43);</script>Four hundred thirty
and five camels, seven thousand thirty and six horses, two hundred forty
and five mules, five thousand five hundred twenty and five beasts used to
the yoke.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,44);</script>And certain of the
chief of their families, when they came to the temple of God that is in
Jerusalem, vowed to set up the house again in his own place according to
their ability,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,45);</script>And to give into the
holy treasury of the works a thousand pounds of gold, five thousand of
silver, and an hundred priestly vestments.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,46);</script>And so dwelt the
priests and the Levites and the people in Jerusalem, and in the country,
the singers also and the porters; and all Israel in their villages.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,47);</script>But when the seventh
month was at hand, and when the children of Israel were every man in his
own place, they came all together with one consent into the open place of
the first gate which is toward the east.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,48);</script>Then stood up Jesus
the son of Josedec, and his brethren the priests and Zorobabel the son of
Salathiel, and his brethren, and made ready the altar of the God of Israel,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,49);</script>To offer burnt
sacrifices upon it, according as it is expressly commanded in the book of
Moses the man of God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,50);</script>And there were
gathered unto them out of the other nations of the land, and they erected
the altar upon his own place, because all the nations of the land were at
enmity with them, and oppressed them; and they offered sacrifices
according to the time, and burnt offerings to the Lord both morning and
evening.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,51);</script>Also they held the
feast of tabernacles, as it is commanded in the law, and offered
sacrifices daily, as was meet:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,52);</script>And after that, the
continual oblations, and the sacrifice of the sabbaths, and of the new
moons, and of all holy feasts.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,53);</script>And all they that had
made any vow to God began to offer sacrifices to God from the first day of
the seventh month, although the temple of the Lord was not yet built.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,54);</script>And they gave unto the
masons and carpenters money, meat, and drink, with cheerfulness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,55);</script>Unto them of Zidon
also and Tyre they gave carrs, that they should bring cedar trees from
Libanus, which should be brought by floats to the haven of Joppa,
according as it was commanded them by Cyrus king of the Persians.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,56);</script>And in the second year
and second month after his coming to the temple of God at Jerusalem began
Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, and Jesus the son of Josedec, and their
brethren, and the priests, and the Levites, and all they that were come
unto Jerusalem out of the captivity:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,57);</script>And they laid the
foundation of the house of God in the first day of the second month, in
the second year after they were come to Jewry and Jerusalem.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,58);</script>And they appointed the
Levites from twenty years old over the works of the Lord. Then stood up
Jesus, and his sons and brethren, and Cadmiel his brother, and the sons of
Madiabun, with the sons of Joda the son of Eliadun, with their sons and
brethren, all Levites, with one accord setters forward of the business,
labouring to advance the works in the house of God. So the workmen built
the temple of the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,59);</script>And the priests stood
arrayed in their vestments with musical instruments and trumpets; and the
Levites the sons of Asaph had cymbals,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,60);</script>Singing songs of
thanksgiving, and praising the Lord, according as David the king of Israel
had ordained.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,61);</script>And they sung with
loud voices songs to the praise of the Lord, because his mercy and glory
is for ever in all Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,62);</script>And all the people
sounded trumpets, and shouted with a loud voice, singing songs of
thanksgiving unto the Lord for the rearing up of the house of the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,63);</script>Also of the priests
and Levites, and of the chief of their families, the ancients who had seen
the former house came to the building of this with weeping and great
crying.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,64);</script>But many with trumpets
and joy shouted with loud voice,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,65);</script>Insomuch that the
trumpets might not be heard for the weeping of the people: yet the
multitude sounded marvellously, so that it was heard afar off.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,66);</script>Wherefore when the
enemies of the tribe of Judah and Benjamin heard it, they came to know
what that noise of trumpets should mean.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,67);</script>And they perceived
that they that were of the captivity did build the temple unto the Lord
God of Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,68);</script>So they went to
Zorobabel and Jesus, and to the chief of the families, and said unto them,
We will build together with you.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,69);</script>For we likewise, as
ye, do obey your Lord, and do sacrifice unto him from the days of
Azbazareth the king of the Assyrians, who brought us hither.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,70);</script>Then Zorobabel and
Jesus and the chief of the families of Israel said unto them, It is not
for us and you to build together an house unto the Lord our God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,71);</script>We ourselves alone
will build unto the Lord of Israel, according as Cyrus the king of the
Persians hath commanded us.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,72);</script>But the heathen of the
land lying heavy upon the inhabitants of Judea, and holding them strait,
hindered their building;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,73);</script>And by their secret
plots, and popular persuasions and commotions, they hindered the finishing
of the building all the time that king Cyrus lived: so they were hindered
from building for the space of two years, until the reign of Darius.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,1);</script>Now in the second year
of the reign of Darius Aggeus and Zacharias the son of Addo, the prophets,
prophesied unto the Jews in Jewry and Jerusalem in the name of the Lord
God of Israel, which was upon them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,2);</script>Then stood up Zorobabel
the son of Salatiel, and Jesus the son of Josedec, and began to build the
house of the Lord at Jerusalem, the prophets of the Lord being with them,
and helping them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,3);</script>At the same time came
unto them Sisinnes the governor of Syria and Phenice, with Sathrabuzanes
and his companions, and said unto them,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,4);</script>By whose appointment do
ye build this house and this roof, and perform all the other things? and
who are the workmen that perform these things?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,5);</script>Nevertheless the elders
of the Jews obtained favour, because the Lord had visited the captivity;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,6);</script>And they were not
hindered from building, until such time as signification was given unto
Darius concerning them, and an answer received.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,7);</script>The copy of the letters
which Sisinnes, governor of Syria and Phenice, and Sathrabuzanes, with
their companions, rulers in Syria and Phenice, wrote and sent unto Darius;
To king Darius, greeting:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,8);</script>Let all things be known
unto our lord the king, that being come into the country of Judea, and
entered into the city of Jerusalem we found in the city of Jerusalem the
ancients of the Jews that were of the captivity
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,9);</script>Building an house unto
the Lord, great and new, of hewn and costly stones, and the timber already
laid upon the walls.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,10);</script>And those works are
done with great speed, and the work goeth on prosperously in their hands,
and with all glory and diligence is it made.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,11);</script>Then asked we these
elders, saying, By whose commandment build ye this house, and lay the
foundations of these works?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,12);</script>Therefore to the
intent that we might give knowledge unto thee by writing, we demanded of
them who were the chief doers, and we required of them the names in
writing of their principal men.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,13);</script>So they gave us this
answer, We are the servants of the Lord which made heaven and earth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,14);</script>And as for this house,
it was builded many years ago by a king of Israel great and strong, and
was finished.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,15);</script>But when our fathers
provoked God unto wrath, and sinned against the Lord of Israel which is in
heaven, he gave them over into the power of Nabuchodonosor king of
Babylon, of the Chaldees;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,16);</script>Who pulled down the
house, and burned it, and carried away the people captives unto Babylon.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,17);</script>But in the first year
that king Cyrus reigned over the country of Babylon Cyrus the king wrote
to build up this house.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,18);</script>And the holy vessels
of gold and of silver, that Nabuchodonosor had carried away out of the
house at Jerusalem, and had set them in his own temple those Cyrus the
king brought forth again out of the temple at Babylon, and they were
delivered to Zorobabel and to Sanabassarus the ruler,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,19);</script>With commandment that
he should carry away the same vessels, and put them in the temple at
Jerusalem; and that the temple of the Lord should be built in his place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,20);</script>Then the same
Sanabassarus, being come hither, laid the foundations of the house of the
Lord at Jerusalem; and from that time to this being still a building, it
is not yet fully ended.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,21);</script>Now therefore, if it
seem good unto the king, let search be made among the records of king
Cyrus:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,22);</script>And if it be found
that the building of the house of the Lord at Jerusalem hath been done
with the consent of king Cyrus, and if our lord the king be so minded, let
him signify unto us thereof.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,23);</script>Then commanded king
Darius to seek among the records at Babylon: and so at Ecbatane the
palace, which is in the country of Media, there was found a roll wherein
these things were recorded.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,24);</script>In the first year of
the reign of Cyrus king Cyrus commanded that the house of the Lord at
Jerusalem should be built again, where they do sacrifice with continual
fire:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,25);</script>Whose height shall be
sixty cubits and the breadth sixty cubits, with three rows of hewn stones,
and one row of new wood of that country; and the expences thereof to be
given out of the house of king Cyrus:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,26);</script>And that the holy
vessels of the house of the Lord, both of gold and silver, that
Nabuchodonosor took out of the house at Jerusalem, and brought to Babylon,
should be restored to the house at Jerusalem, and be set in the place
where they were before.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,27);</script>And also he commanded
that Sisinnes the governor of Syria and Phenice, and Sathrabuzanes, and
their companions, and those which were appointed rulers in Syria and
Phenice, should be careful not to meddle with the place, but suffer
Zorobabel, the servant of the Lord, and governor of Judea, and the elders
of the Jews, to build the house of the Lord in that place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,28);</script>I have commanded also
to have it built up whole again; and that they look diligently to help
those that be of the captivity of the Jews, till the house of the Lord be
finished:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,29);</script>And out of the tribute
of Celosyria and Phenice a portion carefully to be given these men for the
sacrifices of the Lord, that is, to Zorobabel the governor, for bullocks,
and rams, and lambs;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,30);</script>And also corn, salt,
wine, and oil, and that continually every year without further question,
according as the priests that be in Jerusalem shall signify to be daily
spent:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,31);</script>That offerings may be
made to the most high God for the king and for his children, and that they
may pray for their lives.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,32);</script>And he commanded that
whosoever should transgress, yea, or make light of any thing afore spoken
or written, out of his own house should a tree be taken, and he thereon be
hanged, and all his goods seized for the king.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,33);</script>The Lord therefore,
whose name is there called upon, utterly destroy every king and nation,
that stretcheth out his hand to hinder or endamage that house of the Lord
in Jerusalem.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,34);</script>I Darius the king have
ordained that according unto these things it be done with diligence.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,1);</script>Then Sisinnes the
governor of Celosyria and Phenice, and Sathrabuzanes, with their
companions following the commandments of king Darius,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,2);</script>Did very carefully
oversee the holy works, assisting the ancients of the Jews and governors
of the temple.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,3);</script>And so the holy works
prospered, when Aggeus and Zacharias the prophets prophesied.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,4);</script>And they finished these
things by the commandment of the Lord God of Israel, and with the consent
of Cyrus, Darius, and Artexerxes, kings of Persia.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,5);</script>And thus was the holy
house finished in the three and twentieth day of the month Adar, in the
sixth year of Darius king of the Persians
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,6);</script>And the children of
Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and others that were of the
captivity, that were added unto them, did according to the things written
in the book of Moses.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,7);</script>And to the dedication
of the temple of the Lord they offered an hundred bullocks two hundred
rams, four hundred lambs;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,8);</script>And twelve goats for
the sin of all Israel, according to the number of the chief of the tribes
of Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,9);</script>The priests also and
the Levites stood arrayed in their vestments, according to their kindreds,
in the service of the Lord God of Israel, according to the book of Moses:
and the porters at every gate.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,10);</script>And the children of
Israel that were of the captivity held the passover the fourteenth day of
the first month, after that the priests and the Levites were sanctified.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,11);</script>They that were of the
captivity were not all sanctified together: but the Levites were all
sanctified together.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,12);</script>And so they offered
the passover for all them of the captivity, and for their brethren the
priests, and for themselves.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,13);</script>And the children of
Israel that came out of the captivity did eat, even all they that had
separated themselves from the abominations of the people of the land, and
sought the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,14);</script>And they kept the
feast of unleavened bread seven days, making merry before the Lord,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,15);</script>For that he had turned
the counsel of the king of Assyria toward them, to strengthen their hands
in the works of the Lord God of Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,1);</script>And after these things,
when Artexerxes the king of the Persians reigned came Esdras the son of
Saraias, the son of Ezerias, the son of Helchiah, the son of Salum,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,2);</script>The son of Sadduc, the
son of Achitob, the son of Amarias, the son of Ezias, the son of Meremoth,
the son of Zaraias, the son of Savias, the son of Boccas, the son of
Abisum, the son of Phinees, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief
priest.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,3);</script>This Esdras went up
from Babylon, as a scribe, being very ready in the law of Moses, that was
given by the God of Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,4);</script>And the king did him
honour: for he found grace in his sight in all his requests.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,5);</script>There went up with him
also certain of the children of Israel, of the priest of the Levites, of
the holy singers, porters, and ministers of the temple, unto Jerusalem,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,6);</script>In the seventh year of
the reign of Artexerxes, in the fifth month, this was the king’s seventh
year; for they went from Babylon in the first day of the first month, and
came to Jerusalem, according to the prosperous journey which the Lord gave
them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,7);</script>For Esdras had very
great skill, so that he omitted nothing of the law and commandments of the
Lord, but taught all Israel the ordinances and judgments.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,8);</script>Now the copy of the
commission, which was written from Artexerxes the king, and came to Esdras
the priest and reader of the law of the Lord, is this that followeth;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,9);</script>King Artexerxes unto
Esdras the priest and reader of the law of the Lord sendeth greeting:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,10);</script>Having determined to
deal graciously, I have given order, that such of the nation of the Jews,
and of the priests and Levites being within our realm, as are willing and
desirous should go with thee unto Jerusalem.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,11);</script>As many therefore as
have a mind thereunto, let them depart with thee, as it hath seemed good
both to me and my seven friends the counsellors;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,12);</script>That they may look
unto the affairs of Judea and Jerusalem, agreeably to that which is in the
law of the Lord;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,13);</script>And carry the gifts
unto the Lord of Israel to Jerusalem, which I and my friends have vowed,
and all the gold and silver that in the country of Babylon can be found,
to the Lord in Jerusalem,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,14);</script>With that also which
is given of the people for the temple of the Lord their God at Jerusalem:
and that silver and gold may be collected for bullocks, rams, and lambs,
and things thereunto appertaining;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,15);</script>To the end that they
may offer sacrifices unto the Lord upon the altar of the Lord their God,
which is in Jerusalem.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,16);</script>And whatsoever thou
and thy brethren will do with the silver and gold, that do, according to
the will of thy God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,17);</script>And the holy vessels
of the Lord, which are given thee for the use of the temple of thy God,
which is in Jerusalem, thou shalt set before thy God in Jerusalem.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,18);</script>And whatsoever thing
else thou shalt remember for the use of the temple of thy God, thou shalt
give it out of the king’s treasury.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,19);</script>And I king Artexerxes
have also commanded the keepers of the treasures in Syria and Phenice,
that whatsoever Esdras the priest and the reader of the law of the most
high God shall send for, they should give it him with speed,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,20);</script>To the sum of an
hundred talents of silver, likewise also of wheat even to an hundred cors,
and an hundred pieces of wine, and other things in abundance.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,21);</script>Let all things be
performed after the law of God diligently unto the most high God, that
wrath come not upon the kingdom of the king and his sons.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,22);</script>I command you also,
that ye require no tax, nor any other imposition, of any of the priests,
or Levites, or holy singers, or porters, or ministers of the temple, or of
any that have doings in this temple, and that no man have authority to
impose any thing upon them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,23);</script>And thou, Esdras,
according to the wisdom of God ordain judges and justices, that they may
judge in all Syria and Phenice all those that know the law of thy God; and
those that know it not thou shalt teach.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,24);</script>And whosoever shall
transgress the law of thy God, and of the king, shall be punished
diligently, whether it be by death, or other punishment, by penalty of
money, or by imprisonment.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,25);</script>Then said Esdras the
scribe, Blessed be the only Lord God of my fathers, who hath put these
things into the heart of the king, to glorify his house that is in
Jerusalem:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,26);</script>And hath honoured me
in the sight of the king, and his counsellors, and all his friends and
nobles.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,27);</script>Therefore was I
encouraged by the help of the Lord my God, and gathered together men of
Israel to go up with me.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,28);</script>And these are the
chief according to their families and several dignities, that went up with
me from Babylon in the reign of king Artexerxes:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,29);</script>Of the sons of
Phinees, Gerson: of the sons of Ithamar, Gamael: of the sons of David,
Lettus the son of Sechenias:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,30);</script>Of the sons of Pharez,
Zacharias; and with him were counted an hundred and fifty men:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,31);</script>Of the sons of Pahath
Moab, Eliaonias, the son of Zaraias, and with him two hundred men:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,32);</script>Of the sons of Zathoe,
Sechenias the son of Jezelus, and with him three hundred men: of the sons
of Adin, Obeth the son of Jonathan, and with him two hundred and fifty men:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,33);</script>Of the sons of Elam,
Josias son of Gotholias, and with him seventy men:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,34);</script>Of the sons of
Saphatias, Zaraias son of Michael, and with him threescore and ten men:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,35);</script>Of the sons of Joab,
Abadias son of Jezelus, and with him two hundred and twelve men:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,36);</script>Of the sons of Banid,
Assalimoth son of Josaphias, and with him an hundred and threescore men:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,37);</script>Of the sons of Babi,
Zacharias son of Bebai, and with him twenty and eight men:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,38);</script>Of the sons of Astath,
Johannes son of Acatan, and with him an hundred and ten men:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,39);</script>Of the sons of
Adonikam the last, and these are the names of them, Eliphalet, Jewel, and
Samaias, and with them seventy men:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,40);</script>Of the sons of Bago,
Uthi the son of Istalcurus, and with him seventy men.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,41);</script>And these I gathered
together to the river called Theras, where we pitched our tents three
days: and then I surveyed them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,42);</script>But when I had found
there none of the priests and Levites,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,43);</script>Then sent I unto
Eleazar, and Iduel, and Masman,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,44);</script>And Alnathan, and
Mamaias, and Joribas, and Nathan, Eunatan, Zacharias, and Mosollamon,
principal men and learned.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,45);</script>And I bade them that
they should go unto Saddeus the captain, who was in the place of the
treasury:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,46);</script>And commanded them
that they should speak unto Daddeus, and to his brethren, and to the
treasurers in that place, to send us such men as might execute the
priests’ office in the house of the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,47);</script>And by the mighty hand
of our Lord they brought unto us skilful men of the sons of Moli the son
of Levi, the son of Israel, Asebebia, and his sons, and his brethren, who
were eighteen.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,48);</script>And Asebia, and Annus,
and Osaias his brother, of the sons of Channuneus, and their sons, were
twenty men.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,49);</script>And of the servants of
the temple whom David had ordained, and the principal men for the service
of the Levites to wit, the servants of the temple two hundred and twenty,
the catalogue of whose names were shewed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,50);</script>And there I vowed a
fast unto the young men before our Lord, to desire of him a prosperous
journey both for us and them that were with us, for our children, and for
the cattle:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,51);</script>For I was ashamed to
ask the king footmen, and horsemen, and conduct for safeguard against our
adversaries.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,52);</script>For we had said unto
the king, that the power of the Lord our God should be with them that seek
him, to support them in all ways.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,53);</script>And again we besought
our Lord as touching these things, and found him favourable unto us.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,54);</script>Then I separated
twelve of the chief of the priests, Esebrias, and Assanias, and ten men of
their brethren with them:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,55);</script>And I weighed them the
gold, and the silver, and the holy vessels of the house of our Lord, which
the king, and his council, and the princes, and all Israel, had given.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,56);</script>And when I had weighed
it, I delivered unto them six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and
silver vessels of an hundred talents, and an hundred talents of gold,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,57);</script>And twenty golden
vessels, and twelve vessels of brass, even of fine brass, glittering like
gold.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,58);</script>And I said unto them,
Both ye are holy unto the Lord, and the vessels are holy, and the gold and
the silver is a vow unto the Lord, the Lord of our fathers.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,59);</script>Watch ye, and keep
them till ye deliver them to the chief of the priests and Levites, and to
the principal men of the families of Israel, in Jerusalem, into the
chambers of the house of our God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,60);</script>So the priests and the
Levites, who had received the silver and the gold and the vessels, brought
them unto Jerusalem, into the temple of the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,61);</script>And from the river
Theras we departed the twelfth day of the first month, and came to
Jerusalem by the mighty hand of our Lord, which was with us: and from the
beginning of our journey the Lord delivered us from every enemy, and so we
came to Jerusalem.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,62);</script>And when we had been
there three days, the gold and silver that was weighed was delivered in
the house of our Lord on the fourth day unto Marmoth the priest the son of
Iri.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,63);</script>And with him was
Eleazar the son of Phinees, and with them were Josabad the son of Jesu and
Moeth the son of Sabban, Levites: all was delivered them by number and
weight.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,64);</script>And all the weight of
them was written up the same hour.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,65);</script>Moreover they that
were come out of the captivity offered sacrifice unto the Lord God of
Israel, even twelve bullocks for all Israel, fourscore and sixteen rams,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,66);</script>Threescore and twelve
lambs, goats for a peace offering, twelve; all of them a sacrifice to the
Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,67);</script>And they delivered the
king’s commandments unto the king’s stewards’ and to the governors
of Celosyria and Phenice; and they honoured the people and the temple of
God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,68);</script>Now when these things
were done, the rulers came unto me, and said,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,69);</script>The nation of Israel,
the princes, the priests and Levites, have not put away from them the
strange people of the land, nor the pollutions of the Gentiles to wit, of
the Canaanites, Hittites, Pheresites, Jebusites, and the Moabites,
Egyptians, and Edomites.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,70);</script>For both they and
their sons have married with their daughters, and the holy seed is mixed
with the strange people of the land; and from the beginning of this matter
the rulers and the great men have been partakers of this iniquity.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,71);</script>And as soon as I had
heard these things, I rent my clothes, and the holy garment, and pulled
off the hair from off my head and beard, and sat me down sad and very
heavy.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,72);</script>So all they that were
then moved at the word of the Lord God of Israel assembled unto me, whilst
I mourned for the iniquity: but I sat still full of heaviness until the
evening sacrifice.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,73);</script>Then rising up from
the fast with my clothes and the holy garment rent, and bowing my knees,
and stretching forth my hands unto the Lord,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,74);</script>I said, O Lord, I am
confounded and ashamed before thy face;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,75);</script>For our sins are
multiplied above our heads, and our ignorances have reached up unto heaven.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,76);</script>For ever since the
time of our fathers we have been and are in great sin, even unto this day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,77);</script>And for our sins and
our fathers’ we with our brethren and our kings and our priests were
given up unto the kings of the earth, to the sword, and to captivity, and
for a prey with shame, unto this day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,78);</script>And now in some
measure hath mercy been shewed unto us from thee, O Lord, that there
should be left us a root and a name in the place of thy sanctuary;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,79);</script>And to discover unto
us a light in the house of the Lord our God, and to give us food in the
time of our servitude.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,80);</script>Yea, when we were in
bondage, we were not forsaken of our Lord; but he made us gracious before
the kings of Persia, so that they gave us food;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,81);</script>Yea, and honoured the
temple of our Lord, and raised up the desolate Sion, that they have given
us a sure abiding in Jewry and Jerusalem.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,82);</script>And now, O Lord, what
shall we say, having these things? for we have transgressed thy
commandments, which thou gavest by the hand of thy servants the prophets,
saying,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,83);</script>That the land, which
ye enter into to possess as an heritage, is a land polluted with the
pollutions of the strangers of the land, and they have filled it with
their uncleanness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,84);</script>Therefore now shall ye
not join your daughters unto their sons, neither shall ye take their
daughters unto your sons.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,85);</script>Moreover ye shall
never seek to have peace with them, that ye may be strong, and eat the
good things of the land, and that ye may leave the inheritance of the land
unto your children for evermore.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,86);</script>And all that is
befallen is done unto us for our wicked works and great sins; for thou, O
Lord, didst make our sins light,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,87);</script>And didst give unto us
such a root: but we have turned back again to transgress thy law, and to
mingle ourselves with the uncleanness of the nations of the land.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,88);</script>Mightest not thou be
angry with us to destroy us, till thou hadst left us neither root, seed,
nor name?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,89);</script>O Lord of Israel, thou
art true: for we are left a root this day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,90);</script>Behold, now are we
before thee in our iniquities, for we cannot stand any longer by reason of
these things before thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,91);</script>And as Esdras in his
prayer made his confession, weeping, and lying flat upon the ground before
the temple, there gathered unto him from Jerusalem a very great multitude
of men and women and children: for there was great weeping among the
multitude.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,92);</script>Then Jechonias the son
of Jeelus, one of the sons of Israel, called out, and said, O Esdras, we
have sinned against the Lord God, we have married strange women of the
nations of the land, and now is all Israel aloft.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,93);</script>Let us make an oath to
the Lord, that we will put away all our wives, which we have taken of the
heathen, with their children,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,94);</script>Like as thou hast
decreed, and as many as do obey the law of the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,95);</script>Arise and put in
execution: for to thee doth this matter appertain, and we will be with
thee: do valiantly.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,96);</script>So Esdras arose, and
took an oath of the chief of the priests and Levites of all Israel to do
after these things; and so they sware.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,1);</script>Then Esdras rising from
the court of the temple went to the chamber of Joanan the son of Eliasib,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,2);</script>And remained there, and
did eat no meat nor drink water, mourning for the great iniquities of the
multitude.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,3);</script>And there was a
proclamation in all Jewry and Jerusalem to all them that were of the
captivity, that they should be gathered together at Jerusalem:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,4);</script>And that whosoever met
not there within two or three days according as the elders that bare rule
appointed, their cattle should be seized to the use of the temple, and
himself cast out from them that were of the captivity.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,5);</script>And in three days were
all they of the tribe of Judah and Benjamin gathered together at Jerusalem
the twentieth day of the ninth month.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,6);</script>And all the multitude
sat trembling in the broad court of the temple because of the present foul
weather.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,7);</script>So Esdras arose up, and
said unto them, Ye have transgressed the law in marrying strange wives,
thereby to increase the sins of Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,8);</script>And now by confessing
give glory unto the Lord God of our fathers,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,9);</script>And do his will, and
separate yourselves from the heathen of the land, and from the strange
women.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,10);</script>Then cried the whole
multitude, and said with a loud voice, Like as thou hast spoken, so will
we do.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,11);</script>But forasmuch as the
people are many, and it is foul weather, so that we cannot stand without,
and this is not a work of a day or two, seeing our sin in these things is
spread far:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,12);</script>Therefore let the
rulers of the multitude stay, and let all them of our habitations that
have strange wives come at the time appointed,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,13);</script>And with them the
rulers and judges of every place, till we turn away the wrath of the Lord
from us for this matter.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,14);</script>Then Jonathan the son
of Azael and Ezechias the son of Theocanus accordingly took this matter
upon them: and Mosollam and Levis and Sabbatheus helped them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,15);</script>And they that were of
the captivity did according to all these things.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,16);</script>And Esdras the priest
chose unto him the principal men of their families, all by name: and in
the first day of the tenth month they sat together to examine the matter.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,17);</script>So their cause that
held strange wives was brought to an end in the first day of the first
month.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,18);</script>And of the priests
that were come together, and had strange wives, there were found:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,19);</script>Of the sons of Jesus
the son of Josedec, and his brethren; Matthelas and Eleazar, and Joribus
and Joadanus.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,20);</script>And they gave their
hands to put away their wives and to offer rams to make reconcilement for
their errors.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,21);</script>And of the sons of
Emmer; Ananias, and Zabdeus, and Eanes, and Sameius, and Hiereel, and
Azarias.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,22);</script>And of the sons of
Phaisur; Elionas, Massias Israel, and Nathanael, and Ocidelus and Talsas.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,23);</script>And of the Levites;
Jozabad, and Semis, and Colius, who was called Calitas, and Patheus, and
Judas, and Jonas.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,24);</script>Of the holy singers;
Eleazurus, Bacchurus.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,25);</script>Of the porters;
Sallumus, and Tolbanes.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,26);</script>Of them of Israel, of
the sons of Phoros; Hiermas, and Eddias, and Melchias, and Maelus, and
Eleazar, and Asibias, and Baanias.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,27);</script>Of the sons of Ela;
Matthanias, Zacharias, and Hierielus, and Hieremoth, and Aedias.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,28);</script>And of the sons of
Zamoth; Eliadas, Elisimus, Othonias, Jarimoth, and Sabatus, and Sardeus.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,29);</script>Of the sons of Babai;
Johannes, and Ananias and Josabad, and Amatheis.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,30);</script>Of the sons of Mani;
Olamus, Mamuchus, Jedeus, Jasubus, Jasael, and Hieremoth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,31);</script>And of the sons of
Addi; Naathus, and Moosias, Lacunus, and Naidus, and Mathanias, and
Sesthel, Balnuus, and Manasseas.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,32);</script>And of the sons of
Annas; Elionas and Aseas, and Melchias, and Sabbeus, and Simon Chosameus.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,33);</script>And of the sons of
Asom; Altaneus, and Matthias, and Baanaia, Eliphalet, and Manasses, and
Semei.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,34);</script>And of the sons of
Maani; Jeremias, Momdis, Omaerus, Juel, Mabdai, and Pelias, and Anos,
Carabasion, and Enasibus, and Mamnitanaimus, Eliasis, Bannus, Eliali,
Samis, Selemias, Nathanias: and of the sons of Ozora; Sesis, Esril,
Azaelus, Samatus, Zambis, Josephus.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,35);</script>And of the sons of
Ethma; Mazitias, Zabadaias, Edes, Juel, Banaias.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,36);</script>All these had taken
strange wives, and they put them away with their children.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,37);</script>And the priests and
Levites, and they that were of Israel, dwelt in Jerusalem, and in the
country, in the first day of the seventh month: so the children of Israel
were in their habitations.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,38);</script>And the whole
multitude came together with one accord into the broad place of the holy
porch toward the east:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,39);</script>And they spake unto
Esdras the priest and reader, that he would bring the law of Moses, that
was given of the Lord God of Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,40);</script>So Esdras the chief
priest brought the law unto the whole multitude from man to woman, and to
all the priests, to hear law in the first day of the seventh month.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,41);</script>And he read in the
broad court before the holy porch from morning unto midday, before both
men and women; and the multitude gave heed unto the law.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,42);</script>And Esdras the priest
and reader of the law stood up upon a pulpit of wood, which was made for
that purpose.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,43);</script>And there stood up by
him Mattathias, Sammus, Ananias, Azarias, Urias, Ezecias, Balasamus, upon
the right hand:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,44);</script>And upon his left hand
stood Phaldaius, Misael, Melchias, Lothasubus, and Nabarias.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,45);</script>Then took Esdras the
book of the law before the multitude: for he sat honourably in the first
place in the sight of them all.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,46);</script>And when he opened the
law, they stood all straight up. So Esdras blessed the Lord God most High,
the God of hosts, Almighty.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,47);</script>And all the people
answered, Amen; and lifting up their hands they fell to the ground, and
worshipped the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,48);</script>Also Jesus, Anus,
Sarabias, Adinus, Jacubus, Sabateas, Auteas, Maianeas, and Calitas,
Asrias, and Joazabdus, and Ananias, Biatas, the Levites, taught the law of
the Lord, making them withal to understand it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,49);</script>Then spake Attharates
unto Esdras the chief priest. and reader, and to the Levites that taught
the multitude, even to all, saying,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,50);</script>This day is holy unto
the Lord; (for they all wept when they heard the law:)
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,51);</script>Go then, and eat the
fat, and drink the sweet, and send part to them that have nothing;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,52);</script>For this day is holy
unto the Lord: and be not sorrowful; for the Lord will bring you to honour.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,53);</script>So the Levites
published all things to the people, saying, This day is holy to the Lord;
be not sorrowful.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,54);</script>Then went they their
way, every one to eat and drink, and make merry, and to give part to them
that had nothing, and to make great cheer;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,55);</script>Because they
understood the words wherein they were instructed, and for the which they
had been assembled.
