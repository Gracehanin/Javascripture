<h1>
The Epistle [or Letter] of Jeremiah [Jeremy]
</h1><p>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(6,1);</script>A copy of an epistle,
which Jeremy sent unto them which were to be led captives into Babylon by
the king of the Babylonians, to certify them, as it was commanded him of
God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,2);</script>Because of the sins
which ye have committed before God, ye shall be led away captives into
Babylon by Nabuchodonosor king of the Babylonians.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,3);</script>So when ye be come unto
Babylon, ye shall remain there many years, and for a long season, namely,
seven generations: and after that I will bring you away peaceably from
thence.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,4);</script>Now shall ye see in
Babylon gods of silver, and of gold, and of wood, borne upon shoulders,
which cause the nations to fear.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,5);</script>Beware therefore that
ye in no wise be like to strangers, neither be ye and of them, when ye see
the multitude before them and behind them, worshipping them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,6);</script>But say ye in your
hearts, O Lord, we must worship thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,7);</script>For mine angel is with
you, and I myself caring for your souls.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,8);</script>As for their tongue, it
is polished by the workman, and they themselves are gilded and laid over
with silver; yet are they but false, and cannot speak.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,9);</script>And taking gold, as it
were for a virgin that loveth to go gay, they make crowns for the heads of
their gods.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,10);</script>Sometimes also the
priests convey from their gods gold and silver, and bestow it upon
themselves.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,11);</script>Yea, they will give
thereof to the common harlots, and deck them as men with garments,
<I>being</I> gods of silver, and gods of gold, and wood.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,12);</script>Yet cannot these gods
save themselves from rust and moth, though they be covered with purple
raiment.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,13);</script>They wipe their faces
because of the dust of the temple, when there is much upon them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,14);</script>And he that cannot put
to death one that offendeth him holdeth a sceptre, as though he were a
judge of the country.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,15);</script>He hath also in his
right hand a dagger and an ax: but cannot deliver himself from war and
thieves.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,16);</script>Whereby they are known
not to be gods: therefore fear them not.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,17);</script>For like as a vessel
that a man useth is nothing worth when it is broken; even so it is with
their gods: when they be set up in the temple, their eyes be full of dust
through the feet of them that come in.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,18);</script>And as the doors are
made sure on every side upon him that offendeth the king, as being
committed to suffer death: even so the priests make fast their temples
with doors, with locks, and bars, lest their gods be spoiled with robbers.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,19);</script>They light them
candles, yea, more than for themselves, whereof they cannot see one.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,20);</script>They are as one of the
beams of the temple, yet they say their hearts are gnawed upon by things
creeping out of the earth; and when they eat them and their clothes, they
feel it not.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,21);</script>Their faces are
blacked through the smoke that cometh out of the temple.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,22);</script>Upon their bodies and
heads sit bats, swallows, and birds, and the cats also.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,23);</script>By this ye may know
that they are no gods: therefore fear them not.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,24);</script>Notwithstanding the
gold that is about them to make them beautiful, except they wipe off the
rust, they will not shine: for neither when they were molten did they feel
it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,25);</script>The things wherein
there is no breath are bought for a most high price.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,26);</script>They are borne upon
shoulders, having no feet whereby they declare unto men that they be
nothing worth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,27);</script>They also that serve
them are ashamed: for if they fall to the ground at any time, they cannot
rise up again of themselves: neither, if one set them upright, can they
move of themselves: neither, if they be bowed down, can they make
themselves straight: but they set gifts before them as unto dead men.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,28);</script>As for the things that
are sacrificed unto them, their priests sell and abuse; in like manner
their wives lay up part thereof in salt; but unto the poor and impotent
they give nothing of it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,29);</script>Menstruous women and
women in childbed eat their sacrifices: by these things ye may know that
they are no gods: fear them not.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,30);</script>For how can they be
called gods? because women set meat before the gods of silver, gold, and
wood.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,31);</script>And the priests sit in
their temples, having their clothes rent, and their heads and beards
shaven, and nothing upon their heads.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,32);</script>They roar and cry
before their gods, as men do at the feast when one is dead.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,33);</script>The priests also take
off their garments, and clothe their wives and children.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,34);</script>Whether it be evil
that one doeth unto them, or good, they are not able to recompense it:
they can neither set up a king, nor put him down.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,35);</script>In like manner, they
can neither give riches nor money: though a man make a vow unto them, and
keep it not, they will not require it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,36);</script>They can save no man
from death, neither deliver the weak from the mighty.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,37);</script>They cannot restore a
blind man to his sight, nor help any man in his distress.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,38);</script>They can shew no mercy
to the widow, nor do good to the fatherless.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,39);</script>Their gods of wood,
and which are overlaid with gold and silver, are like the stones that be
hewn out of the mountain: they that worship them shall be confounded.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,40);</script>How should a man then
think and say that they are gods, when even the Chaldeans themselves
dishonour them?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,41);</script>Who if they shall see
one dumb that cannot speak, they bring him, and intreat Bel that he may
speak, as though he were able to understand.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,42);</script>Yet they cannot
understand this themselves, and leave them: for they have no knowledge.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,43);</script>The women also with
cords about them, sitting in the ways, burn bran for perfume: but if any
of them, drawn by some that passeth by, lie with him, she reproacheth her
fellow, that she was not thought as worthy as herself, nor her cord broken.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,44);</script>Whatsoever is done
among them is false: how may it then be thought or said that they are gods?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,45);</script>They are made of
carpenters and goldsmiths: they can be nothing else than the workmen will
have them to be.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,46);</script>And they themselves
that made them can never continue long; how should then the things that
are made of them be gods?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,47);</script>For they left lies and
reproaches to them that come after.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,48);</script>For when there cometh
any war or plague upon them, the priests consult with themselves, where
they may be hidden with them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,49);</script>How then cannot men
perceive that they be no gods, which can neither save themselves from war,
nor from plague?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,50);</script>For seeing they be but
of wood, and overlaid with silver and gold, it shall be known hereafter
that they are false:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,51);</script>And it shall
manifestly appear to all nations and kings that they are no gods, but the
works of men’s hands, and that there is no work of God in them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,52);</script>Who then may not know
that they are no gods?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,53);</script>For neither can they
set up a king in the land, nor give rain unto men.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,54);</script>Neither can they judge
their own cause, nor redress a wrong, being unable: for they are as crows
between heaven and earth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,55);</script>Whereupon when fire
falleth upon the house of gods of wood, or laid over with gold or silver,
their priests will flee away, and escape; but they themselves shall be
burned asunder like beams.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,56);</script>Moreover they cannot
withstand any king or enemies: how can it then be thought or said that
they be gods?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,57);</script>Neither are those gods
of wood, and laid over with silver or gold, able to escape either from
thieves or robbers.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,58);</script>Whose gold, and
silver, and garments wherewith they are clothed, they that are strong
take, and go away withal: neither are they able to help themselves.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,59);</script>Therefore it is better
to be a king that sheweth his power, or else a profitable vessel in an
house, which the owner shall have use of, than such false gods; or to be a
door in an house, to keep such things therein, than such false gods. or a
pillar of wood in a a palace, than such false gods.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,60);</script>For sun, moon, and
stars, being bright and sent to do their offices, are obedient.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,61);</script>In like manner the
lightning when it breaketh forth is easy to be seen; and after the same
manner the wind bloweth in every country.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,62);</script>And when God
commandeth the clouds to go over the whole world, they do as they are
bidden.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,63);</script>And the fire sent from
above to consume hills and woods doeth as it is commanded: but these are
like unto them neither in shew nor power.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,64);</script>Wherefore it is
neither to be supposed nor said that they are gods, seeing, they are able
neither to judge causes, nor to do good unto men.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,65);</script>Knowing therefore that
they are no gods, fear them not,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,66);</script>For they can neither
curse nor bless kings:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,67);</script>Neither can they shew
signs in the heavens among the heathen, nor shine as the sun, nor give
light as the moon.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,68);</script>The beasts are better
than they: for they can get under a cover and help themselves.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,69);</script>It is then by no means
manifest unto us that they are gods: therefore fear them not.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,70);</script>For as a scarecrow in
a garden of cucumbers keepeth nothing: so are their gods of wood, and laid
over with silver and gold.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,71);</script>And likewise their
gods of wood, and laid over with silver and gold, are like to a white
thorn in an orchard, that every bird sitteth upon; as also to a dead body,
that is east into the dark.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,72);</script>And ye shall know them
to be no gods by the bright purple that rotteth upon then1: and they
themselves afterward shall be eaten, and shall be a reproach in the
country.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,73);</script>Better therefore is
the just man that hath none idols: for he shall be far from reproach.
