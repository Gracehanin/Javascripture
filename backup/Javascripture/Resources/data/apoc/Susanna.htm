The History of Susanna [in Daniel]
</h1><p>
Set apart from the beginning of Daniel, because it is not in the Hebrew,
as neither the Narration of Bel and the Dragon.
<p>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,1);</script>There dwelt a man in
Babylon, called Joacim:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,2);</script>And he took a wife,
whose name was Susanna, the daughter of Chelcias, a very fair woman, and
one that feared the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,3);</script>Her parents also were
righteous, and taught their daughter according to the law of Moses.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,4);</script>Now Joacim was a great
rich man, and had a fair garden joining unto his house: and to him
resorted the Jews; because he was more honourable than all others.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,5);</script>The same year were
appointed two of the ancients of the people to be judges, such as the Lord
spake of, that wickedness came from Babylon from ancient judges, who
seemed to govern the people.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,6);</script>These kept much at
Joacim’s house: and all that had any suits in law came unto them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,7);</script>Now when the people
departed away at noon, Susanna went into her husband’s garden to walk.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,8);</script>And the two elders saw
her going in every day, and walking; so that their lust was inflamed
toward her.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,9);</script>And they perverted
their own mind, and turned away their eyes, that they might not look unto
heaven, nor remember just judgments.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,10);</script>And albeit they both
were wounded with her love, yet durst not one shew another his grief.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,11);</script>For they were ashamed
to declare their lust, that they desired to have to do with her.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,12);</script>Yet they watched
diligently from day to day to see her.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,13);</script>And the one said to
the other, Let us now go home: for it is dinner time.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,14);</script>So when they were gone
out, they parted the one from the other, and turning back again they came
to the same place; and after that they had asked one another the cause,
they acknowledged their lust: then appointed they a time both together,
when they might find her alone.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,15);</script>And it fell out, as
they watched a fit time, she went in as before with two maids only, and
she was desirous to wash herself in the garden: for it was hot.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,16);</script>And there was no body
there save the two elders, that had hid themselves, and watched her.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,17);</script>Then she said to her
maids, Bring me oil and washing balls, and shut the garden doors, that I
may wash me.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,18);</script>And they did as she
bade them, and shut the garden doors, and went out themselves at privy
doors to fetch the things that she had commanded them: but they saw not
the elders, because they were hid.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,19);</script>Now when the maids
were gone forth, the two elders rose up, and ran unto her, saying,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,20);</script>Behold, the garden
doors are shut, that no man can see us, and we are in love with thee;
therefore consent unto us, and lie with us.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,21);</script>If thou wilt not, we
will bear witness against thee, that a young man was with thee: and
therefore thou didst send away thy maids from thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,22);</script>Then Susanna sighed,
and said, I am straitened on every side: for if I do this thing, it is
death unto me: and if I do it not I cannot escape your hands.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,23);</script>It is better for me to
fall into your hands, and not do it, than to sin in the sight of the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,24);</script>With that Susanna
cried with a loud voice: and the two elders cried out against her.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,25);</script>Then ran the one, and
opened the garden door.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,26);</script>So when the servants
of the house heard the cry in the garden, they rushed in at the privy
door, to see what was done unto her.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,27);</script>But when the elders
had declared their matter, the servants were greatly ashamed: for there
was never such a report made of Susanna.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,28);</script>And it came to pass
the next day, when the people were assembled to her husband Joacim, the
two elders came also full of mischievous imagination against Susanna to
put her to death;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,29);</script>And said before the
people, Send for Susanna, the daughter of Chelcias, Joacim’s wife. And
so they sent.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,30);</script>So she came with her
father and mother, her children, and all her kindred.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,31);</script>Now Susanna was a very
delicate woman, and beauteous to behold.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,32);</script>And these wicked men
commanded to uncover her face, (for she was covered) that they might be
filled with her beauty.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,33);</script>Therefore her friends
and all that saw her wept.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,34);</script>Then the two elders
stood up in the midst of the people, and laid their hands upon her head.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,35);</script>And she weeping looked
up toward heaven: for her heart trusted in the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,36);</script>And the elders said,
As we walked in the garden alone, this woman came in with two maids, and
shut the garden doors, and sent the maids away.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,37);</script>Then a young man, who
there was hid, came unto her, and lay with her.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,38);</script>Then we that stood in
a corner of the garden, seeing this wickedness, ran unto them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,39);</script>And when we saw them
together, the man we could not hold: for he was stronger than we, and
opened the door, and leaped out.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,40);</script>But having taken this
woman, we asked who the young man was, but she would not tell us: these
things do we testify.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,41);</script>Then the assembly
believed them as those that were the elders and judges of the people: so
they condemned her to death.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,42);</script>Then Susanna cried out
with a loud voice, and said, O everlasting God, that knowest the secrets,
and knowest all things before they be:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,43);</script>Thou knowest that they
have borne false witness against me, and, behold, I must die; whereas I
never did such things as these men have maliciously invented against me.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,44);</script>And the Lord heard her
voice.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,45);</script>Therefore when she was
led to be put to death, the Lord raised up the holy spirit of a young
youth whose name was Daniel:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,46);</script>Who cried with a loud
voice, I am clear from the blood of this woman.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,47);</script>Then all the people
turned them toward him, and said, What mean these words that thou hast
spoken?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,48);</script>So he standing in the
midst of them said, Are ye such fools, ye sons of Israel, that without
examination or knowledge of the truth ye have condemned a daughter of
Israel?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,49);</script>Return again to the
place of judgment: for they have borne false witness against her.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,50);</script>Wherefore all the
people turned again in haste, and the elders said unto him, Come, sit down
among us, and shew it us, seeing God hath given thee the honour of an
elder.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,51);</script>Then said Daniel unto
them, Put these two aside one far from another, and I will examine them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,52);</script>So when they were put
asunder one from another, he called one of them, and said unto him, O thou
that art waxen old in wickedness, now thy sins which thou hast committed
aforetime are come to light.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,53);</script>For thou hast
pronounced false judgment and hast condemned the innocent and hast let the
guilty go free; albeit the Lord saith, The innocent and righteous shalt
thou not slay.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,54);</script>Now then, if thou hast
seen her, tell me, Under what tree sawest thou them companying together?
Who answered, Under a mastick tree.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,55);</script>And Daniel said, Very
well; thou hast lied against thine own head; for even now the angel of God
hath received the sentence of God to cut thee in two.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,56);</script>So he put him aside,
and commanded to bring the other, and said unto him, O thou seed of
Chanaan, and not of Juda, beauty hath deceived thee, and lust hath
perverted thine heart.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,57);</script>Thus have ye dealt
with the daughters of Israel, and they for fear companied with you: but
the daughter of Juda would not abide your wickedness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,58);</script>Now therefore tell me,
Under what tree didst thou take them companying together? Who answered,
Under an holm tree.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,59);</script>Then said Daniel unto
him, Well; thou hast also lied against thine own head: for the angel of
God waiteth with the sword to cut thee in two, that he may destroy you.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,60);</script>With that all the
assembly cried out with a loud voice, and praised God, who saveth them
that trust in him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,61);</script>And they arose against
the two elders, for Daniel had convicted them of false witness by their
own mouth:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,62);</script>And according to the
law of Moses they did unto them in such sort as they maliciously intended
to do to their neighbour: and they put them to death. Thus the innocent
blood was saved the same day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,63);</script>Therefore Chelcias and
his wife praised God for their daughter Susanna, with Joacim her husband,
and all the kindred, because there was no dishonesty found in her.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,64);</script>From that day forth
was Daniel had in great reputation in the sight of the people.
