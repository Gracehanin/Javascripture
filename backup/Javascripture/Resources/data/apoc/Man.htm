The Prayer of Manasseh, or, The Prayer of Manasses King of Judah
</h1><p>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,1);</script>O Lord, Almighty God of
our fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and of their righteous seed;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,2);</script>who hast made heaven and
earth, with all the ornament thereof; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,3);</script>who hast bound the sea by the word
of thy commandment; who hast shut up the deep, and sealed it by thy
terrible and glorious name; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,4);</script>whom all men fear, and tremble
before thy power; for the majesty of thy glory cannot be borne, and thine
angry threatening toward sinners is importable: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,5);</script>but thy merciful promise is
unmeasurable and unsearchable; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,6);</script>for thou art the most high Lord,
of great compassion, longsuffering, very merciful, and repentest of the
evils of men. Thou, O Lord, according to thy great goodness hast promised
repentance and forgiveness to them that have sinned against thee: and of
thine infinite mercies hast appointed repentance unto sinners, that they
may be saved. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,7);</script>Thou
therefore, O Lord, that art the God of the just, hast not appointed
repentance to the just, as to Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, which have
not sinned against thee; but thou hast appointed repentance unto me that
am a sinner: <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,8);</script>for I have
sinned above the number of the sands of the sea. My transgressions, O
Lord, are multiplied: my transgressions are multiplied, and I am not
worthy to behold and see the height of heaven for the multitude of mine
iniquities. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,9);</script>I am bowed
down with many iron bands, that I cannot lift up mine head, neither have
any release: for I have provoked thy wrath, and done evil before thee: I
did not thy will, neither kept I thy commandments: I have set up
abominations, and have multiplied offences. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,10);</script>Now therefore I bow the knee of
mine heart, beseeching thee of grace. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,11);</script>I have sinned, O Lord, I have
sinned, and I acknowledge mine iniquities: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,12);</script>wherefore, I humbly beseech thee,
forgive me, O Lord, forgive me, and destroy me not with mine iniquites. Be
not angry with me for ever, by reserving evil for me; neither condemn me
to the lower parts of the earth. For thou art the God, even the God of
them that repent; <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,13);</script>and in
me thou wilt shew all thy goodness: for thou wilt save me, that am
unworthy, according to thy great mercy. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,14);</script>Therefore I will praise thee for
ever all the days of my life: for all the powers of the heavens do praise
thee, and thine is the glory for ever and ever. Amen.
