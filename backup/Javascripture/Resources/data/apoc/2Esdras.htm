The Second Book of Esdras
</h1><p>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,1);</script>The second book of the
prophet Esdras, the son of Saraias, the son of Azarias, the son of
Helchias, the son of Sadamias, the sou of Sadoc, the son of Achitob,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,2);</script>The son of Achias, the
son of Phinees, the son of Heli, the son of Amarias, the son of Aziei, the
son of Marimoth, the son of And he spake unto the of Borith, the son of
Abisei, the son of Phinees, the son of Eleazar,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,3);</script>The son of Aaron, of
the tribe of Levi; which was captive in the land of the Medes, in the
reign of Artexerxes king of the Persians.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,4);</script>And the word of the
Lord came unto me, saying,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,5);</script>Go thy way, and shew my
people their sinful deeds, and their children their wickedness which they
have done against me; that they may tell their children’s children:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,6);</script>Because the sins of
their fathers are increased in them: for they have forgotten me, and have
offered unto strange gods.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,7);</script>Am not I even he that
brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage? but they
have provoked me unto wrath, and despised my counsels.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,8);</script>Pull thou off then the
hair of thy head, and cast all evil upon them, for they have not been
obedient unto my law, but it is a rebellious people.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,9);</script>How long shall I
forbear them, into whom I have done so much good?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,10);</script>Many kings have I
destroyed for their sakes; Pharaoh with his servants and all his power
have I smitten down.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,11);</script>All the nations have I
destroyed before them, and in the east I have scattered the people of two
provinces, even of Tyrus and Sidon, and have slain all their enemies.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,12);</script>Speak thou therefore
unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,13);</script>I led you through the
sea and in the beginning gave you  a large and safe passage; I gave you
Moses for a leader,  and Aaron for a priest.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,14);</script>I gave you light in a
pillar of fire, and great wonders have I done among you; yet have ye
forgotten me, saith the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,15);</script>Thus saith the
Almighty Lord, The quails were as a token to you;  I gave you tents for
your safeguard: nevertheless ye murmured there,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,16);</script>And triumphed not in
my name for the destruction of your enemies,  but ever to this day do ye
yet murmur.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,17);</script>Where are the benefits
that I have done for you? when ye were hungry and thirsty in the
wilderness, did ye not cry unto me,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,18);</script>Saying, Why hast thou
brought us into this wilderness to kill us?  it had been better for us to
have served the Egyptians,  than to die in this wilderness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,19);</script>Then had I pity upon
your mournings, and gave you manna to eat;  so ye did eat angels’ bread.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,20);</script>When ye were thirsty,
did I not cleave the rock, and waters flowed out to your fill? for the
heat I covered you with the leaves of the trees.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,21);</script>I divided among you a
fruitful land, I cast out the Canaanites, the Pherezites, and the
Philistines, before you: what shall I yet do more for you? saith the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,22);</script>Thus saith the
Almighty Lord, When ye were in the wilderness, in the river of the
Amorites, being athirst, and blaspheming my name,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,23);</script>I gave you not fire
for your blasphemies, but cast a tree in the water, and made the river
sweet.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,24);</script>What shall I do unto
thee, O Jacob? thou, Juda, wouldest not obey me: I will turn me to other
nations, and unto those will  I give my name, that they may keep my
statutes.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,25);</script>Seeing ye have
forsaken me, I will forsake you also; when ye desire me to be gracious
unto you, I shall have no mercy upon you.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,26);</script>Whensoever ye shall
call upon me, I will not hear you:  for ye have defiled your hands with
blood, and your feet are swift  to commit manslaughter.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,27);</script>Ye have not as it were
forsaken me, but your own selves, saith the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,28);</script>Thus saith the
Almighty Lord, Have I not prayed you as a father his sons, as a mother her
daughters, and a nurse her young babes,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,29);</script>That ye would be my
people, and I should be your God; that ye would be my children, and I
should be your father?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,30);</script>I gathered you
together, as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings: but now, what
shall I do unto you? I will cast you out from my face.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,31);</script>When ye offer unto me,
I will turn my face from you: for your solemn feastdays, your new moons,
and your circumcisions, have I forsaken.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,32);</script>I sent unto you my
servants the prophets, whom ye have taken and slain, and torn their bodies
in pieces, whose blood I will require of your hands, saith the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,33);</script>Thus saith the
Almighty Lord, Your house is desolate, I will cast you out as the wind
doth stubble.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,34);</script>And your children
shall not be fruitful; for they have despised my commandment, and done the
thing that is an evil before me.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,35);</script>Your houses will I
give to a people that shall come; which not having heard of me yet shall
believe me; to whom I have shewed no signs, yet they shall do that I have
commanded them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,36);</script>They have seen no
prophets, yet they shall call their sins to remembrance, and acknowledge
them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,37);</script>I take to witness the
grace of the people to come, whose little ones rejoice in gladness: and
though they have not seen me with bodily eyes, yet in spirit they believe
the thing that I say.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,38);</script>And now, brother,
behold what glory; and see the people that come from the east:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,39);</script>Unto whom I will give
for leaders, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Oseas, Amos, and Micheas, Joel,
Abdias, and Jonas,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,40);</script>Nahum, and Abacuc,
Sophonias, Aggeus, Zachary, and Malachy, which is called also an angel of
the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,1);</script>Thus saith the Lord, I
brought this people out of bondage, and I gave them my commandments by
menservants the prophets; whom they would not hear, but despised my
counsels.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,2);</script>The mother that bare
them saith unto them, Go your way, ye children; for I am a widow and
forsaken.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,3);</script>I brought you up with
gladness; but with sorrow and heaviness have I lost you: for ye have
sinned before the Lord your God, and done that thing that is evil before
him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,4);</script>But what shall I now do
unto you? I am a widow and forsaken: go your way, O my children, and ask
mercy of the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,5);</script>As for me, O father, I
call upon thee for a witness over the mother of these children, which
would not keep my covenant,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,6);</script>That thou bring them to
confusion, and their mother to a spoil, that there may be no offspring of
them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,7);</script>Let them be scattered
abroad among the heathen, let their names be put out of the earth: for
they have despised my covenant.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,8);</script>Woe be unto thee,
Assur, thou that hidest the unrighteous in thee! O thou wicked people,
remember what I did unto Sodom and Gomorrha;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,9);</script>Whose land lieth in
clods of pitch and heaps of ashes: even so also will I do unto them that
hear me not, saith the Almighty Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,10);</script>Thus saith the Lord
unto Esdras, Tell my people that I will give them the kingdom of
Jerusalem, which I would have given unto Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,11);</script>Their glory also will
I take unto me, and give these the everlasting tabernacles, which I had
prepared for them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,12);</script>They shall have the
tree of life for an ointment of sweet savour; they shall neither labour,
nor be weary.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,13);</script>Go, and ye shall
receive: pray for few days unto you, that they may be shortened: the
kingdom is already prepared for you: watch.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,14);</script>Take heaven and earth
to witness; for I have broken the evil in pieces, and created the good:
for I live, saith the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,15);</script>Mother, embrace thy
children, and bring them up with gladness, make their feet as fast as a
pillar: for I have chosen thee, saith the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,16);</script>And those that be dead
will I raise up again from their places, and bring them out of the graves:
for I have known my name in Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,17);</script>Fear not, thou mother
of the children: for I have chosen thee, saith the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,18);</script>For thy help will I
send my servants Esau and Jeremy, after whose counsel I have sanctified
and prepared for thee twelve trees laden with divers fruits,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,19);</script>And as many fountains
flowing with milk and honey, and seven mighty mountains, whereupon there
grow roses and lilies, whereby I will fill thy children with joy.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,20);</script>Do right to the widow,
judge for the fatherless, give to the poor, defend the orphan, clothe the
naked,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,21);</script>Heal the broken and
the weak, laugh not a lame man to scorn, defend the maimed, and let the
blind man come into the sight of my clearness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,22);</script>Keep the old and young
within thy walls.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,23);</script>Wheresoever thou
findest the dead, take them and bury them, and I will give thee the first
place in my resurrection.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,24);</script>Abide still, O my
people, and take thy rest, for thy quietness still come.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,25);</script>Nourish thy children,
O thou good nurse; stablish their feet.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,26);</script>As for the servants
whom I have given thee, there shall not one of them perish; for I will
require them from among thy number.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,27);</script>Be not weary: for when
the day of trouble and heaviness cometh, others shall weep and be
sorrowful, but thou shalt be merry and have abundance.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,28);</script>The heathen shall envy
thee, but they shall be able to do nothing against thee, saith the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,29);</script>My hands shall cover
thee, so that thy children shall not see hell.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,30);</script>Be joyful, O thou
mother, with thy children; for I will deliver thee, saith the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,31);</script>Remember thy children
that sleep, for I shall bring them out of the sides of the earth, and shew
mercy unto them: for I am merciful, saith the Lord Almighty.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,32);</script>Embrace thy children
until I come and shew mercy unto them: for my wells run over, and my grace
shall not fail.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,33);</script>I Esdras received a
charge of the Lord upon the mount Oreb, that I should go unto Israel; but
when I came unto them, they set me at nought, and despised the commandment
of the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,34);</script>And therefore I say
unto you, O ye heathen, that hear and understand, look for your Shepherd,
he shall give you everlasting rest; for he is nigh at hand, that shall
come in the end of the world.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,35);</script>Be ready to the reward
of the kingdom, for the everlasting light shall shine upon you for
evermore.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,36);</script>Flee the shadow of
this world, receive the joyfulness of your glory: I testify my Saviour
openly.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,37);</script>O receive the gift
that is given you, and be glad, giving thanks unto him that hath led you
to the heavenly kingdom.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,38);</script>Arise up and stand,
behold the number of those that be sealed in the feast of the Lord;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,39);</script>Which are departed
from the shadow of the world, and have received glorious garments of the
Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,40);</script>Take thy number, O
Sion, and shut up those of thine that are clothed in white, which have
fulfilled the law of the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,41);</script>The number of thy
children, whom thou longedst for, is fulfilled: beseech the power of the
Lord, that thy people, which have been called from the beginning, may be
hallowed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,42);</script>I Esdras saw upon the
mount Sion a great people, whom I could not number, and they all praised
the Lord with songs.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,43);</script>And in the midst of
them there was a young man of a high stature, taller than all the rest,
and upon every one of their heads he set crowns, and was more exalted;
which I marvelled at greatly.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,44);</script>So I asked the angel,
and said, Sir, what are these?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,45);</script>He answered and said
unto me, These be they that have put off the mortal clothing, and put on
the immortal, and have confessed the name of God: now are they crowned,
and receive palms.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,46);</script>Then said I unto the
angel, What young person is it that crowneth them, and giveth them palms
in their hands?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,47);</script>So he answered and
said unto me, It is the Son of God, whom they have confessed in the world.
Then began I greatly to commend them that stood so stiffly for the name of
the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,48);</script>Then the angel said
unto me, Go thy way, and tell my people what manner of things, and how
great wonders of the Lord thy God, thou hast seen.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,1);</script>In the thirtieth year
after the ruin of the city I was in Babylon, and lay troubled upon my bed,
and my thoughts came up over my heart:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,2);</script>For I saw the
desolation of Sion, and the wealth of them that dwelt at Babylon.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,3);</script>And my spirit was sore
moved, so that I began to speak words full of fear to the most High, and
said,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,4);</script>O Lord, who bearest
rule, thou spakest at the beginning, when thou didst plant the earth, and
that thyself alone, and commandedst the people,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,5);</script>And gavest a body unto
Adam without soul, which was the workmanship of thine hands, and didst
breathe into him the breath of life, and he was made living before thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,6);</script>And thou leadest him
into paradise, which thy right hand had planted, before ever the earth
came forward.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,7);</script>And unto him thou
gavest commandment to love thy way: which he transgressed, and immediately
thou appointedst death in him and in his generations, of whom came
nations, tribes, people, and kindreds, out of number.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,8);</script>And every people walked
after their own will, and did wonderful things before thee, and despised
thy commandments.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,9);</script>And again in process of
time thou broughtest the flood upon those that dwelt in the world, and
destroyedst them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,10);</script>And it came to pass in
every of them, that as death was to Adam, so was the flood to these.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,11);</script>Nevertheless one of
them thou leftest, namely, Noah with his household, of whom came all
righteous men.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,12);</script>And it happened, that
when they that dwelt upon the earth began to multiply, and had gotten them
many children, and were a great people, they began again to be more
ungodly than the first.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,13);</script>Now when they lived so
wickedly before thee, thou didst choose thee a man from among them, whose
name was Abraham.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,14);</script>Him thou lovedst, and
unto him only thou shewedst thy will:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,15);</script>And madest an
everlasting covenant with him, promising him that thou wouldest never
forsake his seed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,16);</script>And unto him thou
gavest Isaac, and unto Isaac also thou gavest Jacob and Esau. As for
Jacob, thou didst choose him to thee, and put by Esau: and so Jacob became
a great multitude.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,17);</script>And it came to pass,
that when thou leadest his seed out of Egypt, thou broughtest them up to
the mount Sinai.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,18);</script>And bowing the
heavens, thou didst set fast the earth, movedst the whole world, and
madest the depths to tremble, and troubledst the men of that age.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,19);</script>And thy glory went
through four gates, of fire, and of earthquake, and of wind, and of cold;
that thou mightest give the law unto the seed of Jacob, and diligence unto
the generation of Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,20);</script>And yet tookest thou
not away from them a wicked heart, that thy law might bring forth fruit in
them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,21);</script>For the first Adam
bearing a wicked heart transgressed, and was overcome; and so be all they
that are born of him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,22);</script>Thus infirmity was
made permanent; and the law (also) in the heart of the people with the
malignity of the root; so that the good departed away, and the evil abode
still.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,23);</script>So the times passed
away, and the years were brought to an end: then didst thou raise thee up
a servant, called David:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,24);</script>Whom thou commandedst
to build a city unto thy name, and to offer incense and oblations unto
thee therein.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,25);</script>When this was done
many years, then they that inhabited the city forsook thee,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,26);</script>And in all things did
even as Adam and all his generations had done: for they also had a wicked
heart:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,27);</script>And so thou gavest thy
city over into the hands of thine enemies.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,28);</script>Are their deeds then
any better that inhabit Babylon, that they should therefore have the
dominion over Sion?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,29);</script>For when I came
thither, and had seen impieties without number, then my soul saw many
evildoers in this thirtieth year, so that my heart failed me.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,30);</script>For I have seen how
thou sufferest them sinning, and hast spared wicked doers: and hast
destroyed thy people, and hast preserved thine enemies, and hast not
signified it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,31);</script>I do not remember how
this way may be left: Are they then of Babylon better than they of Sion?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,32);</script>Or is there any other
people that knoweth thee beside Israel? or what generation hath so
believed thy covenants as Jacob?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,33);</script>And yet their reward
appeareth not, and their labour hath no fruit: for I have gone here and
there through the heathen, and I see that they flow in wealth, and think
not upon thy commandments.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,34);</script>Weigh thou therefore
our wickedness now in the balance, and their’s also that dwell the
world; and so shall thy name no where be found but in Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,35);</script>Or when was it that
they which dwell upon the earth have not sinned in thy sight? or what
people have so kept thy commandments?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,36);</script>Thou shalt find that
Israel by name hath kept thy precepts; but not the heathen.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,1);</script>And the angel that was
sent unto me, whose name was Uriel, gave me an answer,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,2);</script>And said, Thy heart
hath gone to far in this world, and thinkest thou to comprehend the way of
the most High?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,3);</script>Then said I, Yea, my
lord. And he answered me, and said, I am sent to shew thee three ways, and
to set forth three similitudes before thee:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,4);</script>Whereof if thou canst
declare me one, I will shew thee also the way that thou desirest to see,
and I shall shew thee from whence the wicked heart cometh.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,5);</script>And I said, Tell on, my
lord. Then said he unto me, Go thy way, weigh me the weight of the fire,
or measure me the blast of the wind, or call me again the day that is past.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,6);</script>Then answered I and
said, What man is able to do that, that thou shouldest ask such things of
me?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,7);</script>And he said unto me, If
I should ask thee how great dwellings are in the midst of the sea, or how
many springs are in the beginning of the deep, or how many springs are
above the firmament, or which are the outgoings of paradise:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,8);</script>Peradventure thou
wouldest say unto me, I never went down into the deep, nor as yet into
hell, neither did I ever climb up into heaven.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,9);</script>Nevertheless now have I
asked thee but only of the fire and wind, and of the day wherethrough thou
hast passed, and of things from which thou canst not be separated, and yet
canst thou give me no answer of them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,10);</script>He said moreover unto
me, Thine own things, and such as are grown up with thee, canst thou not
know;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,11);</script>How should thy vessel
then be able to comprehend the way of the Highest, and, the world being
now outwardly corrupted to understand the corruption that is evident in my
sight?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,12);</script>Then said I unto him,
It were better that we were not at all, than that we should live still in
wickedness, and to suffer, and not to know wherefore.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,13);</script>He answered me, and
said, I went into a forest into a plain, and the trees took counsel,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,14);</script>And said, Come, let us
go and make war against the sea that it may depart away before us, and
that we may make us more woods.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,15);</script>The floods of the sea
also in like manner took counsel, and said, Come, let us go up and subdue
the woods of the plain, that there also we may make us another country.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,16);</script>The thought of the
wood was in vain, for the fire came and consumed it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,17);</script>The thought of the
floods of the sea came likewise to nought, for the sand stood up and
stopped them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,18);</script>If thou wert judge now
betwixt these two, whom wouldest thou begin to justify? or whom wouldest
thou condemn?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,19);</script>I answered and said,
Verily it is a foolish thought that they both have devised, for the ground
is given unto the wood, and the sea also hath his place to bear his floods.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,20);</script>Then answered he me,
and said, Thou hast given a right judgment, but why judgest thou not
thyself also?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,21);</script>For like as the ground
is given unto the wood, and the sea to his floods: even so they that dwell
upon the earth may understand nothing but that which is upon the earth:
and he that dwelleth above the heavens may only understand the things that
are above the height of the heavens.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,22);</script>Then answered I and
said, I beseech thee, O Lord, let me have understanding:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,23);</script>For it was not my mind
to be curious of the high things, but of such as pass by us daily, namely,
wherefore Israel is given up as a reproach to the heathen, and for what
cause the people whom thou hast loved is given over unto ungodly nations,
and why the law of our forefathers is brought to nought, and the written
covenants come to none effect,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,24);</script>And we pass away out
of the world as grasshoppers, and our life is astonishment and fear, and
we are not worthy to obtain mercy.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,25);</script>What will he then do
unto his name whereby we are called? of these things have I asked.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,26);</script>Then answered he me,
and said, The more thou searchest, the more thou shalt marvel; for the
world hasteth fast to pass away,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,27);</script>And cannot comprehend
the things that are promised to the righteous in time to come: for this
world is full of unrighteousness and infirmities.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,28);</script>But as concerning the
things whereof thou askest me, I will tell thee; for the evil is sown, but
the destruction thereof is not yet come.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,29);</script>If therefore that
which is sown be not turned upside down, and if the place where the evil
is sown pass not away, then cannot it come that is sown with good.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,30);</script>For the grain of evil
seed hath been sown in the heart of Adam from the beginning, and how much
ungodliness hath it brought up unto this time? and how much shall it yet
bring forth until the time of threshing come?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,31);</script>Ponder now by thyself,
how great fruit of wickedness the grain of evil seed hath brought forth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,32);</script>And when the ears
shall be cut down, which are without number, how great a floor shall they
fill?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,33);</script>Then I answered and
said, How, and when shall these things come to pass? wherefore are our
years few and evil?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,34);</script>And he answered me,
saying, Do not thou hasten above the most Highest: for thy haste is in
vain to be above him, for thou hast much exceeded.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,35);</script>Did not the souls also
of the righteous ask question of these things in their chambers, saying,
How long shall I hope on this fashion? when cometh the fruit of the floor
of our reward?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,36);</script>And unto these things
Uriel the archangel gave them answer, and said, Even when the number of
seeds is filled in you: for he hath weighed the world in the balance.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,37);</script>By measure hath he
measured the times; and by number hath he numbered the times; and he doth
not move nor stir them, until the said measure be fulfilled.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,38);</script>Then answered I and
said, O Lord that bearest rule, even we all are full of impiety.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,39);</script>And for our sakes
peradventure it is that the floors of the righteous are not filled,
because of the sins of them that dwell upon the earth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,40);</script>So he answered me, and
said, Go thy way to a woman with child, and ask of her when she hath
fulfilled her nine months, if her womb may keep the birth any longer
within her.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,41);</script>Then said I, No, Lord,
that can she not. And he said unto me, In the grave the chambers of souls
are like the womb of a woman:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,42);</script>For like as a woman
that travaileth maketh haste to escape the necessity of the travail: even
so do these places haste to deliver those things that are committed unto
them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,43);</script>From the beginning,
look, what thou desirest to see, it shall be shewed thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,44);</script>Then answered I and
said, If I have found favour in thy sight, and if it be possible, and if I
be meet therefore,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,45);</script>Shew me then whether
there be more to come than is past, or more past than is to come.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,46);</script>What is past I know,
but what is for to come I know not.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,47);</script>And he said unto me,
Stand up upon the right side, and I shall expound the similitude unto thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,48);</script>So I stood, and saw,
and, behold, an hot burning oven passed by before me: and it happened that
when the flame was gone by I looked, and, behold, the smoke remained still.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,49);</script>After this there
passed by before me a watery cloud, and sent down much rain with a storm;
and when the stormy rain was past, the drops remained still.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,50);</script>Then said he unto me,
Consider with thyself; as the rain is more than the drops, and as the fire
is greater than the smoke; but the drops and the smoke remain behind: so
the quantity which is past did more exceed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,51);</script>Then I prayed, and
said, May I live, thinkest thou, until that time? or what shall happen in
those days?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,52);</script>He answered me, and
said, As for the tokens whereof thou askest me, I may tell thee of them in
part: but as touching thy life, I am not sent to shew thee; for I do not
know it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,1);</script>Nevertheless as coming
the tokens, behold, the days shall come, that they which dwell upon earth
shall be taken in a great number, and the way of truth shall be hidden,
and the land shall be barren of faith.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,2);</script>But iniquity shall be
increased above that which now thou seest, or that thou hast heard long
ago.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,3);</script>And the land, that thou
seest now to have root, shalt thou see wasted suddenly.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,4);</script>But if the most High
grant thee to live, thou shalt see after the third trumpet that the sun
shall suddenly shine again in the night, and the moon thrice in the day:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,5);</script>And blood shall drop
out of wood, and the stone shall give his voice, and the people shall be
troubled:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,6);</script>And even he shall rule,
whom they look not for that dwell upon the earth, and the fowls shall take
their flight away together:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,7);</script>And the Sodomitish sea
shall cast out fish, and make a noise in the night, which many have not
known: but they shall all hear the voice thereof.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,8);</script>There shall be a
confusion also in many places, and the fire shall be oft sent out again,
and the wild beasts shall change their places, and menstruous women shall
bring forth monsters:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,9);</script>And salt waters shall
be found in the sweet, and all friends shall destroy one another; then
shall wit hide itself, and understanding withdraw itself into his secret
chamber,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,10);</script>And shall be sought of
many, and yet not be found: then shall unrighteousness and incontinency be
multiplied upon earth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,11);</script>One land also shall
ask another, and say, Is righteousness that maketh a man righteous gone
through thee? And it shall say, No.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,12);</script>At the same time shall
men hope, but nothing obtain: they shall labour, but their ways shall not
prosper.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,13);</script>To shew thee such
tokens I have leave; and if thou wilt pray again, and weep as now, and
fast even days, thou shalt hear yet greater things.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,14);</script>Then I awaked, and an
extreme fearfulness went through all my body, and my mind was troubled, so
that it fainted.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,15);</script>So the angel that was
come to talk with me held me, comforted me, and set me up upon my feet.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,16);</script>And in the second
night it came to pass, that Salathiel the captain of the people came unto
me, saying, Where hast thou been? and why is thy countenance so heavy?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,17);</script>Knowest thou not that
Israel is committed unto thee in the land of their captivity?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,18);</script>Up then, and eat
bread, and forsake us not, as the shepherd that leaveth his flock in the
hands of cruel wolves.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,19);</script>Then said I unto him,
Go thy ways from me, and come not nigh me. And he heard what I said, and
went from me.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,20);</script>And so I fasted seven
days, mourning and weeping, like as Uriel the angel commanded me.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,21);</script>And after seven days
so it was, that the thoughts of my heart were very grievous unto me again,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,22);</script>And my soul recovered
the spirit of understanding, and I began to talk with the most High again,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,23);</script>And said, O Lord that
bearest rule, of every wood of the earth, and of all the trees thereof,
thou hast chosen thee one only vine:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,24);</script>And of all lands of
the whole world thou hast chosen thee one pit: and of all the flowers
thereof one lily:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,25);</script>And of all the depths
of the sea thou hast filled thee one river: and of all builded cities thou
hast hallowed Sion unto thyself:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,26);</script>And of all the fowls
that are created thou hast named thee one dove: and of all the cattle that
are made thou hast provided thee one sheep:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,27);</script>And among all the
multitudes of people thou hast gotten thee one people: and unto this
people, whom thou lovedst, thou gavest a law that is approved of all.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,28);</script>And now, O Lord, why
hast thou given this one people over unto many? and upon the one root hast
thou prepared others, and why hast thou scattered thy only one people
among many?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,29);</script>And they which did
gainsay thy promises, and believed not thy covenants, have trodden them
down.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,30);</script>If thou didst so much
hate thy people, yet shouldest thou punish them with thine own hands.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,31);</script>Now when I had spoken
these words, the angel that came to me the night afore was sent unto me,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,32);</script>And said unto me, Hear
me, and I will instruct thee; hearken to the thing that I say, and I shall
tell thee more.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,33);</script>And I said, Speak on,
my Lord. Then said he unto me, Thou art sore troubled in mind for
Israel’s sake: lovest thou that people better than he that made them?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,34);</script>And I said, No, Lord:
but of very grief have I spoken: for my reins pain me every hour, while I
labour to comprehend the way of the most High, and to seek out part of his
judgment.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,35);</script>And he said unto me,
Thou canst not. And I said, Wherefore, Lord? whereunto was I born then? or
why was not my mother’s womb then my grave, that I might not have seen
the travail of Jacob, and the wearisome toil of the stock of Israel?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,36);</script>And he said unto me,
Number me the things that are not yet come, gather me together the dross
that are scattered abroad, make me the flowers green again that are
withered,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,37);</script>Open me the places
that are closed, and bring me forth the winds that in them are shut up,
shew me the image of a voice: and then I will declare to thee the thing
that thou labourest to know.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,38);</script>And I said, O Lord
that bearest rule, who may know these things, but he that hath not his
dwelling with men?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,39);</script>As for me, I am
unwise: how may I then speak of these things whereof thou askest me?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,40);</script>Then said he unto me,
Like as thou canst do none of these things that I have spoken of, even so
canst thou not find out my judgment, or in the end the love that I have
promised unto my people.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,41);</script>And I said, Behold, O
Lord, yet art thou nigh unto them that be reserved till the end: and what
shall they do that have been before me, or we that be now, or they that
shall come after us?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,42);</script>And he said unto me, I
will liken my judgment unto a ring: like as there is no slackness of the
last, even so there is no swiftness of the first.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,43);</script>So I answered and
said, Couldest thou not make those that have been made, and be now, and
that are for to come, at once; that thou mightest shew thy judgment the
sooner?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,44);</script>Then answered he me,
and said, The creature may not haste above the maker; neither may the
world hold them at once that shall be created therein.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,45);</script>And I said, As thou
hast said unto thy servant, that thou, which givest life to all, hast
given life at once to the creature that thou hast created, and the
creature bare it: even so it might now also bear them that now be present
at once.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,46);</script>And he said unto me,
Ask the womb of a woman, and say unto her, If thou bringest forth
children, why dost thou it not together, but one after another? pray her
therefore to bring forth ten children at once.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,47);</script>And I said, She
cannot: but must do it by distance of time.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,48);</script>Then said he unto me,
Even so have I given the womb of the earth to those that be sown in it in
their times.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,49);</script>For like as a young
child may not bring forth the things that belong to the aged, even so have
I disposed the world which I created.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,50);</script>And I asked, and said,
Seeing thou hast now given me the way, I will proceed to speak before
thee: for our mother, of whom thou hast told me that she is young, draweth
now nigh unto age.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,51);</script>He answered me, and
said, Ask a woman that beareth children, and she shall tell thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,52);</script>Say unto her,
Wherefore are unto they whom thou hast now brought forth like those that
were before, but less of stature?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,53);</script>And she shall answer
thee, They that be born in the the strength of youth are of one fashion,
and they that are born in the time of age, when the womb faileth, are
otherwise.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,54);</script>Consider thou
therefore also, how that ye are less of stature than those that were
before you.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,55);</script>And so are they that
come after you less than ye, as the creatures which now begin to be old,
and have passed over the strength of youth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,56);</script>Then said I, Lord, I
beseech thee, if I have found favour in thy sight, shew thy servant by
whom thou visitest thy creature.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,1);</script>And he said unto me, In
the beginning, when the earth was made, before the borders of the world
stood, or ever the winds blew,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,2);</script>Before it thundered and
lightened, or ever the foundations of paradise were laid,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,3);</script>Before the fair flowers
were seen, or ever the moveable powers were established, before the
innumerable multitude of angels were gathered together,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,4);</script>Or ever the heights of
the air were lifted up, before the measures of the firmament were named,
or ever the chimneys in Sion were hot,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,5);</script>And ere the present
years were sought out, and or ever the inventions of them that now sin
were turned, before they were sealed that have gathered faith for a
treasure:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,6);</script>Then did I consider
these things, and they all were made through me alone, and through none
other: by me also they shall be ended, and by none other.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,7);</script>Then answered I and
said, What shall be the parting asunder of the times? or when shall be the
end of the first, and the beginning of it that followeth?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,8);</script>And he said unto me,
From Abraham unto Isaac, when Jacob and Esau were born of him, Jacob’s
hand held first the heel of Esau.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,9);</script>For Esau is the end of
the world, and Jacob is the beginning of it that followeth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,10);</script>The hand of man is
betwixt the heel and the hand: other question, Esdras, ask thou not.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,11);</script>I answered then and
said, O Lord that bearest rule, if I have found favour in thy sight,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,12);</script>I beseech thee, shew
thy servant the end of thy tokens, whereof thou shewedst me part the last
night.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,13);</script>So he answered and
said unto me, Stand up upon thy feet, and hear a mighty sounding voice.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,14);</script>And it shall be as it
were a great motion; but the place where thou standest shall not be moved.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,15);</script>And therefore when it
speaketh be not afraid: for the word is of the end, and the foundation of
the earth is understood.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,16);</script>And why? because the
speech of these things trembleth and is moved: for it knoweth that the end
of these things must be changed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,17);</script>And it happened, that
when I had heard it I stood up upon my feet, and hearkened, and, behold,
there was a voice that spake, and the sound of it was like the sound of
many waters.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,18);</script>And it said, Behold,
the days come, that I will begin to draw nigh, and to visit them that
dwell upon the earth,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,19);</script>And will begin to make
inquisition of them, what they be that have hurt unjustly with their
unrighteousness, and when the affliction of Sion shall be fulfilled;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,20);</script>And when the world,
that shall begin to vanish away, shall be finished, then will I shew these
tokens: the books shall be opened before the firmament, and they shall see
all together:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,21);</script>And the children of a
year old shall speak with their voices, the women with child shall bring
forth untimely children of three or four months old, and they shall live,
and be raised up.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,22);</script>And suddenly shall the
sown places appear unsown, the full storehouses shall suddenly be found
empty:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,23);</script>And tha trumpet shall
give a sound, which when every man heareth, they shall be suddenly afraid.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,24);</script>At that time shall
friends fight one against another like enemies, and the earth shall stand
in fear with those that dwell therein, the springs of the fountains shall
stand still, and in three hours they shall not run.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,25);</script>Whosoever remaineth
from all these that I have told thee shall escape, and see my salvation,
and the end of your world.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,26);</script>And the men that are
received shall see it, who have not tasted death from their birth: and the
heart of the inhabitants shall be changed, and turned into another meaning.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,27);</script>For evil shall be put
out, and deceit shall be quenched.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,28);</script>As for faith, it shall
flourish, corruption shall be overcome, and the truth, which hath been so
long without fruit, shall be declared.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,29);</script>And when he talked
with me, behold, I looked by little and little upon him before whom I
stood.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,30);</script>And these words said
he unto me; I am come to shew thee the time of the night to come.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,31);</script>If thou wilt pray yet
more, and fast seven days again, I shall tell thee greater things by day
than I have heard.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,32);</script>For thy voice is heard
before the most High: for the Mighty hath seen thy righteous dealing, he
hath seen also thy chastity, which thou hast had ever since thy youth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,33);</script>And therefore hath he
sent me to shew thee all these things, and to say unto thee, Be of good
comfort and fear not
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,34);</script>And hasten not with
the times that are past, to think vain things, that thou mayest not hasten
from the latter times.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,35);</script>And it came to pass
after this, that I wept again, and fasted seven days in like manner, that
I might fulfil the three weeks which he told me.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,36);</script>And in the eighth
night was my heart vexed within me again, and I began to speak before the
most High.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,37);</script>For my spirit was
greatly set on fire, and my soul was in distress.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,38);</script>And I said, O Lord,
thou spakest from the beginning of the creation, even the first day, and
saidst thus; Let heaven and earth be made; and thy word was a perfect work.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,39);</script>And then was the
spirit, and darkness and silence were on every side; the sound of man’s
voice was not yet formed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,40);</script>Then commandedst thou
a fair light to come forth of thy treasures, that thy work might appear.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,41);</script>Upon the second day
thou madest the spirit of the firmament, and commandedst it to part
asunder, and to make a division betwixt the waters, that the one part
might go up, and the other remain beneath.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,42);</script>Upon the third day
thou didst command that the waters should be gathered in the seventh part
of the earth: six pats hast thou dried up, and kept them, to the intent
that of these some being planted of God and tilled might serve thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,43);</script>For as soon as thy
word went forth the work was made.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,44);</script>For immediately there
was great and innumerable fruit, and many and divers pleasures for the
taste, and flowers of unchangeable colour, and odours of wonderful smell:
and this was done the third day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,45);</script>Upon the fourth day
thou commandedst that the sun should shine, and the moon give her light,
and the stars should be in order:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,46);</script>And gavest them a
charge to do service unto man, that was to be made.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,47);</script>Upon the fifth day
thou saidst unto the seventh part, where the waters were gathered that it
should bring forth living creatures, fowls and fishes: and so it came to
pass.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,48);</script>For the dumb water and
without life brought forth living things at the commandment of God, that
all people might praise thy wondrous works.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,49);</script>Then didst thou ordain
two living creatures, the one thou calledst Enoch, and the other Leviathan;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,50);</script>And didst separate the
one from the other: for the seventh part, namely, where the water was
gathered together, might not hold them both.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,51);</script>Unto Enoch thou gavest
one part, which was dried up the third day, that he should dwell in the
same part, wherein are a thousand hills:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,52);</script>But unto Leviathan
thou gavest the seventh part, namely, the moist; and hast kept him to be
devoured of whom thou wilt, and when.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,53);</script>Upon the sixth day
thou gavest commandment unto the earth, that before thee it should bring
forth beasts, cattle, and creeping things:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,54);</script>And after these, Adam
also, whom thou madest lord of all thy creatures: of him come we all, and
the people also whom thou hast chosen.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,55);</script>All this have I spoken
before thee, O Lord, because thou madest the world for our sakes
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,56);</script>As for the other
people, which also come of Adam, thou hast said that they are nothing, but
be like unto spittle: and hast likened the abundance of them unto a drop
that falleth from a vessel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,57);</script>And now, O Lord,
behold, these heathen, which have ever been reputed as nothing, have begun
to be lords over us, and to devour us.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,58);</script>But we thy people,
whom thou hast called thy firstborn, thy only begotten, and thy fervent
lover, are given into their hands.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,59);</script>If the world now be
made for our sakes, why do we not possess an inheritance with the world?
how long shall this endure?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,1);</script>And when I had made an
end of speaking these words, there was sent unto me the angel which had
been sent unto me the nights afore:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,2);</script>And he said unto me,
Up, Esdras, and hear the words that I am come to tell thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,3);</script>And I said, Speak on,
my God. Then said he unto me, The sea is set in a wide place, that it
might be deep and great.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,4);</script>But put the case the
entrance were narrow, and like a river;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,5);</script>Who then could go into
the sea to look upon it, and to rule it? if he went not through the
narrow, how could he come into the broad?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,6);</script>There is also another
thing; A city is builded, and set upon a broad field, and is full of all
good things:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,7);</script>The entrance thereof is
narrow, and is set in a dangerous place to fall, like as if there were a
fire on the right hand, and on the left a deep water:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,8);</script>And one only path
between them both, even between the fire and the water, so small that
there could but one man go there at once.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,9);</script>If this city now were
given unto a man for an inheritance, if he never shall pass the danger set
before it, how shall he receive this inheritance?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,10);</script>And I said, It is so,
Lord. Then said he unto me, Even so also is Israel’s portion.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,11);</script>Because for their
sakes I made the world: and when Adam transgressed my statutes, then was
decreed that now is done.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,12);</script>Then were the
entrances of this world made narrow, full of sorrow and travail: they are
but few and evil, full of perils,: and very painful.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,13);</script>For the entrances of
the elder world were wide and sure, and brought immortal fruit.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,14);</script>If then they that live
labour not to enter these strait and vain things, they can never receive
those that are laid up for them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,15);</script>Now therefore why
disquietest thou thyself, seeing thou art but a corruptible man? and why
art thou moved, whereas thou art but mortal?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,16);</script>Why hast thou not
considered in thy mind this thing that is to come, rather than that which
is present?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,17);</script>Then answered I and
said, O Lord that bearest rule, thou hast ordained in thy law, that the
righteous should inherit these things, but that the ungodly should perish.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,18);</script>Nevertheless the
righteous shall suffer strait things, and hope for wide: for they that
have done wickedly have suffered the strait things, and yet shall not see
the wide.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,19);</script>And he said unto me.
There is no judge above God, and none that hath understanding above the
Highest.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,20);</script>For there be many that
perish in this life, because they despise the law of God that is set
before them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,21);</script>For God hath given
strait commandment to such as came, what they should do to live, even as
they came, and what they should observe to avoid punishment.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,22);</script>Nevertheless they were
not obedient unto him; but spake against him, and imagined vain things;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,23);</script>And deceived
themselves by their wicked deeds; and said of the most High, that he is
not; and knew not his ways:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,24);</script>But his law have they
despised, and denied his covenants; in his statutes have they not been
faithful, and have not performed his works.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,25);</script>And therefore, Esdras,
for the empty are empty things, and for the full are the full things.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,26);</script>Behold, the time shall
come, that these tokens which I have told thee shall come to pass, and the
bride shall appear, and she coming forth shall be seen, that now is
withdrawn from the earth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,27);</script>And whosoever is
delivered from the foresaid evils shall see my wonders.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,28);</script>For my son Jesus shall
be revealed with those that be with him, and they that remain shall
rejoice within four hundred years.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,29);</script>After these years
shall my son Christ die, and all men that have life.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,30);</script>And the world shall be
turned into the old silence seven days, like as in the former judgments:
so that no man shall remain.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,31);</script>And after seven days
the world, that yet awaketh not, shall be raised up, and that shall die
that is corrupt
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,32);</script>And the earth shall
restore those that are asleep in her, and so shall the dust those that
dwell in silence, and the secret places shall deliver those souls that
were committed unto them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,33);</script>And the most High
shall appear upon the seat of judgment, and misery shall pass away, and
the long suffering shall have an end:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,34);</script>But judgment only
shall remain, truth shall stand, and faith shall wax strong:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,35);</script>And the work shall
follow, and the reward shall be shewed, and the good deeds shall be of
force, and wicked deeds shall bear no rule.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,36);</script>Then said I, Abraham
prayed first for the Sodomites, and Moses for the fathers that sinned in
the wilderness:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,37);</script>And Jesus after him
for Israel in the time of Achan:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,38);</script>And Samuel and David
for the destruction: and Solomon for them that should come to the
sanctuary:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,39);</script>And Helias for those
that received rain; and for the dead, that he might live:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,40);</script>And Ezechias for the
people in the time of Sennacherib: and many for many.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,41);</script>Even so now, seeing
corruption is grown up, and wickedness increased, and the righteous have
prayed for the ungodly: wherefore shall it not be so now also?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,42);</script>He answered me, and
said, This present life is not the end where much glory doth abide;
therefore have they prayed for the weak.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,43);</script>But the day of doom
shall be the end of this time, and the beginning of the immortality for to
come, wherein corruption is past,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,44);</script>Intemperance is at an
end, infidelity is cut off, righteousness is grown, and truth is sprung up.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,45);</script>Then shall no man be
able to save him that is destroyed, nor to oppress him that hath gotten
the victory.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,46);</script>I answered then and
said, This is my first and last saying, that it had been better not to
have given the earth unto Adam: or else, when it was given him, to have
restrained him from sinning.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,47);</script>For what profit is it
for men now in this present time to live in heaviness, and after death to
look for punishment?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,48);</script>O thou Adam, what hast
thou done? for though it was thou that sinned, thou art not fallen alone,
but we all that come of thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,49);</script>For what profit is it
unto us, if there be promised us an immortal time, whereas we have done
the works that bring death?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,50);</script>And that there is
promised us an everlasting hope, whereas ourselves being most wicked are
made vain?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,51);</script>And that there are
laid up for us dwellings of health and safety, whereas we have lived
wickedly?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,52);</script>And that the glory of
the most High is kept to defend them which have led a wary life, whereas
we have walked in the most wicked ways of all?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,53);</script>And that there should
be shewed a paradise, whose fruit endureth for ever, wherein is security
and medicine, since we shall not enter into it?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,54);</script>(For we have walked in
unpleasant places.)
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,55);</script>And that the faces of
them which have used abstinence shall shine above the stars, whereas our
faces shall be blacker than darkness?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,56);</script>For while we lived and
committed iniquity, we considered not that we should begin to suffer for
it after death.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,57);</script>Then answered he me,
and said, This is the condition of the battle, which man that is born upon
the earth shall fight;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,58);</script>That, if he be
overcome, he shall suffer as thou hast said: but if he get the victory, he
shall receive the thing that I say.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,59);</script>For this is the life
whereof Moses spake unto the people while he lived, saying, Choose thee
life, that thou mayest live.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,60);</script>Nevertheless they
believed not him, nor yet the prophets after him, no nor me which have
spoken unto them,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,61);</script>That there should not
be such heaviness in their destruction, as shall be joy over them that are
persuaded to salvation.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,62);</script>I answered then, and
said, I know, Lord, that the most High is called merciful, in that he hath
mercy upon them which are not yet come into the world,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,63);</script>And upon those also
that turn to his law;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,64);</script>And that he is
patient, and long suffereth those that have sinned, as his creatures;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,65);</script>And that he is
bountiful, for he is ready to give where it needeth;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,66);</script>And that he is of
great mercy, for he multiplieth more and more mercies to them that are
present, and that are past, and also to them which are to come.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,67);</script>For if he shall not
multiply his mercies, the world would not continue with them that inherit
therein.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,68);</script>And he pardoneth; for
if he did not so of his goodness, that they which have committed
iniquities might be eased of them, the ten thousandth part of men should
not remain living.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,69);</script>And being judge, if he
should not forgive them that are cured with his word, and put out the
multitude of contentions,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,70);</script>There should be very
few left peradventure in an innumerable multitude.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,1);</script>And he answered me,
saying, The most High hath made this world for many, but the world to come
for few.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,2);</script>I will tell thee a
similitude, Esdras; As when thou askest the earth, it shall say unto thee,
that it giveth much mould whereof earthen vessels are made, but little
dust that gold cometh of: even so is the course of this present world.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,3);</script>There be many created,
but few shall be saved.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,4);</script>So answered I and said,
Swallow then down, O my soul, understanding, and devour wisdom.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,5);</script>For thou hast agreed to
give ear, and art willing to prophesy: for thou hast no longer space than
only to live.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,6);</script>O Lord, if thou suffer
not thy servant, that we may pray before thee, and thou give us seed unto
our heart, and culture to our understanding, that there may come fruit of
it; how shall each man live that is corrupt, who beareth the place of a
man?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,7);</script>For thou art alone, and
we all one workmanship of thine hands, like as thou hast said.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,8);</script>For when the body is
fashioned now in the mother’s womb, and thou givest it members, thy
creature is preserved in fire and water, and nine months doth thy
workmanship endure thy creature which is created in her.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,9);</script>But that which keepeth
and is kept shall both be preserved: and when the time cometh, the womb
preserved delivereth up the things that grew in it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,10);</script>For thou hast
commanded out of the parts of the body, that is to say, out of the
breasts, milk to be given, which is the fruit of the breasts,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,11);</script>That the thing which
is fashioned may be nourished for a time, till thou disposest it to thy
mercy.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,12);</script>Thou broughtest it up
with thy righteousness, and nurturedst it in thy law, and reformedst it
with thy judgment.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,13);</script>And thou shalt mortify
it as thy creature, and quicken it as thy work.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,14);</script>If therefore thou
shalt destroy him which with so great labour was fashioned, it is an easy
thing to be ordained by thy commandment, that the thing which was made
might be preserved.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,15);</script>Now therefore, Lord, I
will speak; touching man in general, thou knowest best; but touching thy
people, for whose sake I am sorry;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,16);</script>And for thine
inheritance, for whose cause I mourn; and for Israel, for whom I am heavy;
and for Jacob, for whose sake I am troubled;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,17);</script>Therefore will I begin
to pray before thee for myself and for them: for I see the falls of us
that dwell in the land.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,18);</script>But I have heard the
swiftness of the judge which is to come.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,19);</script>Therefore hear my
voice, and understand my words, and I shall speak before thee. This is the
beginning of the words of Esdras, before he was taken up: and I said,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,20);</script>O Lord, thou that
dwellest in everlastingness which beholdest from above things in the
heaven and in the air;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,21);</script>Whose throne is
inestimable; whose glory may not be comprehended; before whom the hosts of
angels stand with trembling,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,22);</script>Whose service is
conversant in wind and fire; whose word is true, and sayings constant;
whose commandment is strong, and ordinance fearful;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,23);</script>Whose look drieth up
the depths, and indignation maketh the mountains to melt away; which the
truth witnesseth:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,24);</script>O hear the prayer of
thy servant, and give ear to the petition of thy creature.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,25);</script>For while I live I
will speak, and so long as I have understanding I will answer.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,26);</script>O look not upon the
sins of thy people; but on them which serve thee in truth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,27);</script>Regard not the wicked
inventions of the heathen, but the desire of those that keep thy
testimonies in afflictions.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,28);</script>Think not upon those
that have walked feignedly before thee: but remember them, which according
to thy will have known thy fear.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,29);</script>Let it not be thy will
to destroy them which have lived like beasts; but to look upon them that
have clearly taught thy law.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,30);</script>Take thou no
indignation at them which are deemed worse than beasts; but love them that
always put their trust in thy righteousness and glory.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,31);</script>For we and our fathers
do languish of such diseases: but because of us sinners thou shalt be
called merciful.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,32);</script>For if thou hast a
desire to have mercy upon us, thou shalt be called merciful, to us namely,
that have no works of righteousness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,33);</script>For the just, which
have many good works laid up with thee, shall out of their own deeds
receive reward.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,34);</script>For what is man, that
thou shouldest take displeasure at him? or what is a corruptible
generation, that thou shouldest be so bitter toward it?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,35);</script>For in truth them is
no man among them that be born, but he hath dealt wickedly; and among the
faithful there is none which hath not done amiss.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,36);</script>For in this, O Lord,
thy righteousness and thy goodness shall be declared, if thou be merciful
unto them which have not the confidence of good works.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,37);</script>Then answered he me,
and said, Some things hast thou spoken aright, and according unto thy
words it shall be.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,38);</script>For indeed I will not
think on the disposition of them which have sinned before death, before
judgment, before destruction:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,39);</script>But I will rejoice
over the disposition of the righteous, and I will remember also their
pilgrimage, and the salvation, and the reward, that they shall have.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,40);</script>Like as I have spoken
now, so shall it come to pass.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,41);</script>For as the husbandman
soweth much seed upon the ground, and planteth many trees, and yet the
thing that is sown good in his season cometh not up, neither doth all that
is planted take root: even so is it of them that are sown in the world;
they shall not all be saved.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,42);</script>I answered then and
said, If I have found grace, let me speak.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,43);</script>Like as the
husbandman’s seed perisheth, if it come not up, and receive not thy rain
in due season; or if there come too much rain, and corrupt it:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,44);</script>Even so perisheth man
also, which is formed with thy hands, and is called thine own image,
because thou art like unto him, for whose sake thou hast made all things,
and likened him unto the husbandman’s seed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,45);</script>Be not wroth with us
but spare thy people, and have mercy upon thine own inheritance: for thou
art merciful unto thy creature.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,46);</script>Then answered he me,
and said, Things present are for the present, and things to cometh for
such as be to come.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,47);</script>For thou comest far
short that thou shouldest be able to love my creature more than I: but I
have ofttimes drawn nigh unto thee, and unto it, but never to the
unrighteous.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,48);</script>In this also thou art
marvellous before the most High:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,49);</script>In that thou hast
humbled thyself, as it becometh thee, and hast not judged thyself worthy
to be much glorified among the righteous.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,50);</script>For many great
miseries shall be done to them that in the latter time shall dwell in the
world, because they have walked in great pride.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,51);</script>But understand thou
for thyself, and seek out the glory for such as be like thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,52);</script>For unto you is
paradise opened, the tree of life is planted, the time to come is
prepared, plenteousness is made ready, a city is builded, and rest is
allowed, yea, perfect goodness and wisdom.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,53);</script>The root of evil is
sealed up from you, weakness and the moth is hid from you, and corruption
is fled into hell to be forgotten:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,54);</script>Sorrows are passed,
and in the end is shewed the treasure of immortality.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,55);</script>And therefore ask thou
no more questions concerning the multitude of them that perish.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,56);</script>For when they had
taken liberty, they despised the most High, thought scorn of his law, and
forsook his ways.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,57);</script>Moreover they have
trodden down his righteous,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,58);</script>And said in their
heart, that there is no God; yea, and that knowing they must die.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,59);</script>For as the things
aforesaid shalt receive you, so thirst and pain are prepared for them: for
it was not his will that men should come to nought:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,60);</script>But they which be
created have defiled the name of him that made them, and were unthankful
unto him which prepared life for them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,61);</script>And therefore is my
judgment now at hand.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,62);</script>These things have I
not shewed unto all men, but unto thee, and a few like thee. Then answered
I and said,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,63);</script>Behold, O Lord, now
hast thou shewed me the multitude of the wonders, which thou wilt begin to
do in the last times: but at what time, thou hast not shewed me.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,1);</script>He answered me then,
and said, Measure thou the time diligently in itself: and when thou seest
part of the signs past, which I have told thee before,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,2);</script>Then shalt thou
understand, that it is the very same time, wherein the Highest will begin
to visit the world which he made.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,3);</script>Therefore when there
shall be seen earthquakes and uproars of the people in the world:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,4);</script>Then shalt thou well
understand, that the most High spake of those things from the days that
were before thee, even from the beginning.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,5);</script>For like as all that is
made in the world hath a beginning and an end, and the end is manifest:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,6);</script>Even so the times also
of the Highest have plain beginnings in wonder and powerful works, and
endings in effects and signs.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,7);</script>And every one that
shall be saved, and shall be able to escape by his works, and by faith,
whereby ye have believed,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,8);</script>Shall be preserved from
the said perils, and shall see my salvation in my land, and within my
borders: for I have sanctified them for me from the beginning.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,9);</script>Then shall they be in
pitiful case, which now have abused my ways: and they that have cast them
away despitefully shall dwell in torments.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,10);</script>For such as in their
life have received benefits, and have not known me;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,11);</script>And they that have
loathed my law, while they had yet liberty, and, when as yet place of
repentance was open unto them, understood not, but despised it;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,12);</script>The same must know it
after death by pain.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,13);</script>And therefore be thou
not curious how the ungodly shall be punished, and when: but enquire how
the righteous shall be saved, whose the world is, and for whom the world
is created.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,14);</script>Then answered I and
said,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,15);</script>I have said before,
and now do speak, and will speak it also hereafter, that there be many
more of them which perish, than of them which shall be saved:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,16);</script>Like as a wave is
greater than a drop.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,17);</script>And he answered me,
saying, Like as the field is, so is also the seed; as the flowers be, such
are the colours also; such as the workman is, such also is the work; and
as the husbandman ls himself, so is his husbandry also: for it was the
time of the world.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,18);</script>And now when I
prepared the world, which was not yet made, even for them to dwell in that
now live, no man spake against me.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,19);</script>For then every one
obeyed: but now the manners of them which are created in this world that
is made are corrupted by a perpetual seed, and by a law which is
unsearchable rid themselves.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,20);</script>So I considered the
world, and, behold, there was peril because of the devices that were come
into it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,21);</script>And I saw, and spared
it greatly, and have kept me a grape of the cluster, and a plant of a
great people.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,22);</script>Let the multitude
perish then, which was born in vain; and let my grape be kept, and my
plant; for with great labour have I made it perfect.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,23);</script>Nevertheless, if thou
wilt cease yet seven days more, (but thou shalt not fast in them,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,24);</script>But go into a field of
flowers, where no house is builded, and eat only the flowers of the field;
taste no flesh, drink no wine, but eat flowers only;)
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,25);</script>And pray unto the
Highest continually, then will I come and talk with thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,26);</script>So I went my way into
the field which is called Ardath, like as he commanded me; and there I sat
among the flowers, and did eat of the herbs of the field, and the meat of
the same satisfied me.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,27);</script>After seven days I sat
upon the grass, and my heart was vexed within me, like as before:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,28);</script>And I opened my mouth,
and began to talk before the most High, and said,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,29);</script>O Lord, thou that
shewest thyself unto us, thou wast shewed unto our fathers in the
wilderness, in a place where no man treadeth, in a barren place, when they
came out of Egypt.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,30);</script>And thou spakest
saying, Hear me, O Israel; and mark my words, thou seed of Jacob.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,31);</script>For, behold, I sow my
law in you, and it shall bring fruit in you, and ye shall be honoured in
it for ever.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,32);</script>But our fathers, which
received the law, kept it not, and observed not thy ordinances: and though
the fruit of thy law did not perish, neither could it, for it was thine;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,33);</script>Yet they that received
it perished, because they kept not the thing that was sown in them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,34);</script>And, lo, it ls a
custom, when the ground hath received seed, or the sea a ship, or any
vessel meat or drink, that, that being perished wherein it was sown or
cast into,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,35);</script>That thing also which
was sown, or cast therein, or received, doth perish, and remaineth not
with us: but with us it hath not happened so.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,36);</script>For we that have
received the law perish by sin, and our heart also which received it
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,37);</script>Notwithstanding the
law perisheth not, but remaineth in his force.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,38);</script>And when I spake these
things in my heart, I looked back with mine eyes, and upon the right side
I saw a woman, and, behold, she mourned and wept with a loud voice, and
was much grieved in heart, and her clothes were rent, and she had ashes
upon her head.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,39);</script>Then let I my thoughts
go that I was in, and turned me unto her,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,40);</script>And said unto her,
Wherefore weepest thou? why art thou so grieved in thy mind?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,41);</script>And she said unto me,
Sir, let me alone, that I may bewail myself, and add unto my sorrow, for I
am sore vexed in my mind, and brought very low.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,42);</script>And I said unto her,
What aileth thee? tell me.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,43);</script>She said unto me, I
thy servant have been barren, and had no child, though I had an husband
thirty years,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,44);</script>And those thirty years
I did nothing else day and night, and every hour, but make my, prayer to
the Highest.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,45);</script>After thirty years God
heard me thine handmaid, looked upon my misery, considered my trouble, and
gave me a son: and I was very glad of him, so was my husband also, and all
my neighbours: and we gave great honour unto the Almighty.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,46);</script>And I nourished him
with great travail.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,47);</script>So when he grew up,
and came to the time that he should have a wife, I made a feast.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,1);</script>And it so came to
pass, that when my son was entered into his wedding chamber, he fell down,
and died.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,2);</script>Then we all overthrew
the lights, and all my neighbours rose up to comfort me: so I took my rest
unto the second day at night.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,3);</script>And it came to pass,
when they had all left off to comfort me, to the end I might be quiet;
then rose I up by night and fled, and came hither into this field, as thou
seest.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,4);</script>And I do now purpose
not to return into the city, but here to stay, and neither to eat nor
drink, but continually to mourn and to fast until I die.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,5);</script>Then left I the
meditations wherein I was, and spake to her in anger, saying,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,6);</script>Thou foolish woman
above all other, seest thou not our mourning, and what happeneth unto us?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,7);</script>How that Sion our
mother is full of all heaviness, and much humbled, mourning very sore?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,8);</script>And now, seeing we all
mourn and are sad, for we are all in heaviness, art thou grieved for one
son?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,9);</script>For ask the earth, and
she shall tell thee, that it is she which ought to mourn for the fall of
so many that grow upon her.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,10);</script>For out of her came
all at the first, and out of her shall all others come, and, behold, they
walk almost all into destruction, and a multitude of them is utterly
rooted out.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,11);</script>Who then should make
more mourning than she, that hath lost so great a multitude; and not thou,
which art sorry but for one?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,12);</script>But if thou sayest
unto me, My lamentation is not like the earth’s, because I have lost the
fruit of my womb, which I brought forth with pains, and bare with sorrows;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,13);</script>But the earth not so:
for the multitude present in it according to the course of the earth is
gone, as it came:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,14);</script>Then say I unto thee,
Like as thou hast brought forth with labour; even so the earth also hath
given her fruit, namely, man, ever since the beginning unto him that made
her.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,15);</script>Now therefore keep
thy sorrow to thyself, and bear with a good courage that which hath
befallen thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,16);</script>For if thou shalt
acknowledge the determination of God to be just, thou shalt both receive
thy son in time, and shalt be commended among women.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,17);</script>Go thy way then into
the city to thine husband.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,18);</script>And she said unto me,
That will I not do: I will not go into the city, but here will I die.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,19);</script>So I proceeded to
speak further unto her, and said,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,20);</script>Do not so, but be
counselled. by me: for how many are the adversities of Sion? be comforted
in regard of the sorrow of Jerusalem.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,21);</script>For thou seest that
our sanctuary is laid waste, our altar broken down, our temple destroyed;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,22);</script>Our psaltery is laid
on the ground, our song is put to silence, our rejoicing is at an end, the
light of our candlestick is put out, the ark of our covenant is spoiled,
our holy things are defiled, and the name that is called upon us is almost
profaned: our children are put to shame, our priests are burnt, our
Levites are gone into captivity, our virgins are defiled, and our wives
ravished; our righteous men carried away, our little ones destroyed, our
young men are brought in bondage, and our strong men are become weak;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,23);</script>And, which is the
greatest of all, the seal of Sion hath now lost her honour; for she is
delivered into the hands of them that hate us.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,24);</script>And therefore shake
off thy great heaviness, and put away the multitude of sorrows, that the
Mighty may be merciful unto thee again, and the Highest shall give thee
rest and ease from thy labour.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,25);</script>And it came to pass
while I was talking with her, behold, her face upon a sudden shined
exceedingly, and her countenance glistered, so that I was afraid of her,
and mused what it might be.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,26);</script>And, behold, suddenly
she made a great cry very fearful: so that the earth shook at the noise of
the woman.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,27);</script>And I looked, and,
behold, the woman appeared unto me no more, but there was a city builded,
and a large place shewed itself from the foundations: then was I afraid,
and cried with a loud voice, and said,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,28);</script>Where is Uriel the
angel, who came unto me at the first? for he hath caused me to fall into
many trances, and mine end is turned into corruption, and my prayer to
rebuke.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,29);</script>And as I was speaking
these words behold, he came unto me, and looked upon me.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,30);</script>And, lo, I lay as one
that had been dead, and mine understanding was taken from me: and he took
me by the right hand, and comforted me, and set me upon my feet, and said
unto me,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,31);</script>What aileth thee? and
why art thou so disquieted? and why is thine understanding troubled, and
the thoughts of thine heart?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,32);</script>And I said, Because
thou hast forsaken me, and yet I did according to thy words, and I went
into the field, and, lo, I have seen, and yet see, that I am not able to
express.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,33);</script>And he said unto me,
Stand up manfully, and I will advise thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,34);</script>Then said I, Speak
on, my lord, in me; only forsake me not, lest I die frustrate of my hope.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,35);</script>For I have seen that
I knew not, and hear that I do not know.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,36);</script>Or is my sense
deceived, or my soul in a dream?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,37);</script>Now therefore I
beseech thee that thou wilt shew thy servant of this vision.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,38);</script>He answered me then,
and said, Hear me, and I shall inform thee, and tell thee wherefore thou
art afraid: for the Highest will reveal many secret things unto thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,39);</script>He hath seen that thy
way is right: for that thou sorrowest continually for thy people, and
makest great lamentation for Sion.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,40);</script>This therefore is the
meaning of the vision which thou lately sawest:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,41);</script>Thou sawest a woman
mourning, and thou begannest to comfort her:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,42);</script>But now seest thou
the likeness of the woman no more, but there appeared unto thee a city
builded.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,43);</script>And whereas she told
thee of the death of her son, this is the solution:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,44);</script>This woman, whom thou
sawest is Sion: and whereas she said unto thee, even she whom thou seest
as a city builded,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,45);</script>Whereas, I say, she
said unto thee, that she hath been thirty years barren: those are the
thirty years wherein there was no offering made in her.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,46);</script>But after thirty
years Solomon builded the city and offered offerings: and then bare the
barren a son.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,47);</script>And whereas she told
thee that she nourished him with labour: that was the dwelling in
Jerusalem.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,48);</script>But whereas she said
unto thee, That my son coming into his marriage chamber happened to have a
fail, and died: this was the destruction that came to Jerusalem.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,49);</script>And, behold, thou
sawest her likeness, and because she mourned for her son, thou begannest
to comfort her: and of these things which have chanced, these are to be
opened unto thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,50);</script>For now the most High
seeth that thou art grieved unfeignedly, and sufferest from thy whole
heart for her, so hath he shewed thee the brightness of her glory, and the
comeliness of her beauty:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,51);</script>And therefore I bade
thee remain in the field where no house was builded:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,52);</script>For I knew that the
Highest would shew this unto thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,53);</script>Therefore I commanded
thee to go into the field, where no foundation of any building was.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,54);</script>For in the place
wherein the Highest beginneth to shew his city, there can no man’s
building be able to stand.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,55);</script>And therefore fear
not, let not thine heart be affrighted, but go thy way in, and see the
beauty and greatness of the building, as much as thine eyes be able to see:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,56);</script>And then shalt thou
hear as much as thine ears may comprehend.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,57);</script>For thou art blessed
above many other, and art called with the Highest; and so are but few.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,58);</script>But to morrow at
night thou shalt remain here;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,59);</script>And so shall the
Highest shew thee visions of the high things, which the most High will do
unto them that dwell upon the earth in the last days. So I slept that
night and another, like as he commanded me.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,1);</script>Then saw I a dream,
and, behold, there came up from the sea an eagle, which had twelve
feathered wings, and three heads.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,2);</script>And I saw, and,
behold, she spread her wings over all the earth, and all the winds of the
air blew on her, and were gathered together.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,3);</script>And I beheld, and out
of her feathers there grew other contrary feathers; and they became little
feathers and small.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,4);</script>But her heads were at
rest: the head in the midst was greater than the other, yet rested it with
the residue.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,5);</script>Moreover I beheld,
and, lo, the eagle flew with her feathers, and reigned upon earth, and
over them that dwelt therein.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,6);</script>And I saw that all
things under heaven were subject unto her, and no man spake against her,
no, not one creature upon earth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,7);</script>And I beheld, and, lo,
the eagle rose upon her talons, and spake to her feathers, saying,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,8);</script>Watch not all at once:
sleep every one in his own place, and watch by course:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,9);</script>But let the heads be
preserved for the last.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,10);</script>And I beheld, and,
lo, the voice went not out of her heads, but from the midst of her body.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,11);</script>And I numbered her
contrary feathers, and, behold, there were eight of them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,12);</script>And I looked, and,
behold, on the right side there arose one feather, and reigned over all
the earth;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,13);</script>And so it was, that
when it reigned, the end of it came, and the place thereof appeared no
more: so the next following stood up. and reigned, and had a great time;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,14);</script>And it happened, that
when it reigned, the end of it came also, like as the first, so that it
appeared no more.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,15);</script>Then came there a
voice unto it, and said,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,16);</script>Hear thou that hast
borne rule over the earth so long: this I say unto thee, before thou
beginnest to appear no more,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,17);</script>There shall none
after thee attain unto thy time, neither unto the half thereof.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,18);</script>Then arose the third,
and reigned as the other before, and appeared no more also.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,19);</script>So went it with all
the residue one after another, as that every one reigned, and then
appeared no more.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,20);</script>Then I beheld, and,
lo, in process of time the feathers that followed stood up upon the right
side, that they might rule also; and some of them ruled, but within a
while they appeared no more:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,21);</script>For some of them were
set up, but ruled not.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,22);</script>After this I looked,
and, behold, the twelve feathers appeared no more, nor the two little
feathers:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,23);</script>And there was no more
upon the eagle’s body, but three heads that rested, and six little wings.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,24);</script>Then saw I also that
two little feathers divided themselves from the six, and remained under
the head that was upon the right side: for the four continued in their
place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,25);</script>And I beheld, and,
lo, the feathers that were under the wing thought to set up themselves and
to have the rule.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,26);</script>And I beheld, and,
lo, there was one set up, but shortly it appeared no more.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,27);</script>And the second was
sooner away than the first.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,28);</script>And I beheld, and,
lo, the two that remained thought also in themselves to reign:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,29);</script>And when they so
thought, behold, there awaked one of the heads that were at rest, namely,
it that was in the midst; for that was greater than the two other heads.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,30);</script>And then I saw that
the two other heads were joined with it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,31);</script>And, behold, the head
was turned with them that were with it, and did eat up the two feathers
under the wing that would have reigned.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,32);</script>But this head put the
whole earth in fear, and bare rule in it over all those that dwelt upon
the earth with much oppression; and it had the governance of the world
more than all the wings that had been.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,33);</script>And after this I
beheld, and, lo, the head that was in the midst suddenly appeared no more,
like as the wings.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,34);</script>But there remained
the two heads, which also in like sort ruled upon the earth, and over
those that dwelt therein.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,35);</script>And I beheld, and,
lo, the head upon the right side devoured it that was upon the left side.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,36);</script>Then I head a voice,
which said unto me, Look before thee, and consider the thing that thou
seest.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,37);</script>And I beheld, and lo,
as it were a roaring lion chased out of the wood: and I saw that he sent
out a man’s voice unto the eagle, and said,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,38);</script>Hear thou, I will
talk with thee, and the Highest shall say unto thee,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,39);</script>Art not thou it that
remainest of the four beasts, whom I made to reign in my world, that the
end of their times might come through them?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,40);</script>And the fourth came,
and overcame all the beasts that were past, and had power over the world
with great fearfulness, and over the whole compass of the earth with much
wicked oppression; and so long time dwelt he upon the earth with deceit.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,41);</script>For the earth hast
thou not judged with truth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,42);</script>For thou hast
afflicted the meek, thou hast hurt the peaceable, thou hast loved liars,
and destroyed the dwellings of them that brought forth fruit, and hast
cast down the walls of such as did thee no harm.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,43);</script>Therefore is thy
wrongful dealing come up unto the Highest, and thy pride unto the Mighty.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,44);</script>The Highest also hath
looked upon the proud times, and, behold, they are ended, and his
abominations are fulfilled.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,45);</script>And therefore appear
no more, thou eagle, nor thy horrible wings, nor thy wicked feathers nor
thy malicious heads, nor thy hurtful claws, nor all thy vain body:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,46);</script>That all the earth
may be refreshed, and may return, being delivered from thy violence, and
that she may hope for the judgment and mercy of him that made her.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,1);</script>And it came to pass,
whiles the lion spake these words unto the eagle, I saw,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,2);</script>And, behold, the head
that remained and the four wings appeared no more, and the two went unto
it and set themselves up to reign, and their kingdom was small, and fill
of uproar.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,3);</script>And I saw, and,
behold, they appeared no more, and the whole body of the eagle was burnt
so that the earth was in great fear: then awaked I out of the trouble and
trance of my mind, and from great fear, and said unto my spirit,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,4);</script>Lo, this hast thou
done unto me, in that thou searchest out the ways of the Highest.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,5);</script>Lo, yet am I weary in
my mind, and very weak in my spirit; and little strength is there in me,
for the great fear wherewith I was afflicted this night.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,6);</script>Therefore will I now
beseech the Highest, that he will comfort me unto the end.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,7);</script>And I said, Lord that
bearest rule, if I have found grace before thy sight, and if I am
justified with thee before many others, and if my prayer indeed be come up
before thy face;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,8);</script>Comfort me then, and
shew me thy servant the interpretation and plain difference of this
fearful vision, that thou mayest perfectly comfort my soul.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,9);</script>For thou hast judged
me worthy to shew me the last times.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,10);</script>And he said unto me,
This is the interpretation of the vision:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,11);</script>The eagle, whom thou
sawest come up from the sea, is the kingdom which was seen in the vision
of thy brother Daniel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,12);</script>But it was not
expounded unto him, therefore now I declare it unto thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,13);</script>Behold, the days will
come, that there shall rise up a kingdom upon earth, and it shall be
feared above all the kingdoms that were before it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,14);</script>In the same shall
twelve kings reign, one after another:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,15);</script>Whereof the second
shall begin to reign, and shall have more time than any of the twelve.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,16);</script>And this do the
twelve wings signify, which thou sawest.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,17);</script>As for the voice
which thou heardest speak, and that thou sawest not to go out from the
heads but from the midst of the body thereof, this is the interpretation:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,18);</script>That after the time
of that kingdom there shall arise great strivings, and it shall stand in
peril of failing: nevertheless it shall not then fall, but shall be
restored again to his beginning.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,19);</script>And whereas thou
sawest the eight small under feathers sticking to her wings, this is the
interpretation:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,20);</script>That in him there
shall arise eight kings, whose times shall be but small, and their years
swift.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,21);</script>And two of them shall
perish, the middle time approaching: four shall be kept until their end
begin to approach: but two shall be kept unto the end.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,22);</script>And whereas thou
sawest three heads resting, this is the interpretation:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,23);</script>In his last days
shall the most High raise up three kingdoms, and renew many things
therein, and they shall have the dominion of the earth,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,24);</script>And of those that
dwell therein, with much oppression, above all those that were before
them: therefore are they called the heads of the eagle.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,25);</script>For these are they
that shall accomplish his wickedness, and that shall finish his last end.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,26);</script>And whereas thou
sawest that the great head appeared no more, it signifieth that one of
them shall die upon his bed, and yet with pain.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,27);</script>For the two that
remain shall be slain with the sword.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,28);</script>For the sword of the
one shall devour the other: but at the last shall he fall through the
sword himself.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,29);</script>And whereas thou
sawest two feathers under the wings passing over the head that is on the
right side;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,30);</script>It signifieth that
these are they, whom the Highest hath kept unto their end: this is the
small kingdom and full of trouble, as thou sawest.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,31);</script>And the lion, whom
thou sawest rising up out of the wood, and roaring, and speaking to the
eagle, and rebuking her for her unrighteousness with all the words which
thou hast heard;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,32);</script>This is the anointed,
which the Highest hath kept for them and for their wickedness unto the
end: he shall reprove them, and shall upbraid them with their cruelty.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,33);</script>For he shall set them
before him alive in judgment, and shall rebuke them, and correct them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,34);</script>For the rest of my
people shall he deliver with mercy, those that have been pressed upon my
borders, and he shall make them joyful until the coming of the day of
judgment, whereof I have spoken unto thee from the the beginning.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,35);</script>This is the dream
that thou sawest, and these are the interpretations.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,36);</script>Thou only hast been
meet to know this secret of the Highest.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,37);</script>Therefore write all
these things that thou hast seen in a book, and hide them:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,38);</script>And teach them to the
wise of the people, whose hearts thou knowest may comprehend and keep
these secrets.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,39);</script>But wait thou here
thyself yet seven days more, that it may be shewed thee, whatsoever it
pleaseth the Highest to declare unto thee. And with that he went his way.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,40);</script>And it came to pass,
when all the people saw that the seven days were past, and I not come
again into the city, they gathered them all together, from the least unto
the greatest, and came unto me, and said,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,41);</script>What have we offended
thee? and what evil have we done against thee, that thou forsakest us, and
sittest here in this place?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,42);</script>For of all the
prophets thou only art left us, as a cluster of the vintage, and as a
candle in a dark place, and as a haven or ship preserved from the tempest.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,43);</script>Are not the evils
which are come to us sufficient?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,44);</script>If thou shalt forsake
us, how much better had it been for us, if we also had been burned in the
midst of Sion?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,45);</script>For we are not better
than they that died there. And they wept with a loud voice. Then answered
I them, and said,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,46);</script>Be of good comfort, O
Israel; and be not heavy, thou house of Jacob:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,47);</script>For the Highest hath
you in remembrance, and the Mighty hath not forgotten you in temptation.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,48);</script>As for me, I have not
forsaken you, neither am I departed from you: but am come into this place,
to pray for the desolation of Sion, and that I might seek mercy for the
low estate of your sanctuary.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,49);</script>And now go your way
home every man, and after these days will I come unto you.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,50);</script>So the people went
their way into the city, like as I commanded them:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,51);</script>But I remained still
in the field seven days, as the angel commanded me; and did eat only in
those days of the flowers of the field, and had my meat of the herbs
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,1);</script>And it came to pass
after seven days, I dreamed a dream by night:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,2);</script>And, lo, there arose a
wind from the sea, that it moved all the waves thereof.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,3);</script>And I beheld, and, lo,
that man waxed strong with the thousands of heaven: and when he turned his
countenance to look, all the things trembled that were seen under him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,4);</script>And whensoever the
voice went out of his mouth, all they burned that heard his voice, like as
the earth faileth when it feeleth the fire.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,5);</script>And after this I
beheld, and, lo, there was gathered together a multitude of men, out of
number, from the four winds of the heaven, to subdue the man that came out
of the sea
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,6);</script>But I beheld, and, lo,
he had graved himself a great mountain, and flew up upon it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,7);</script>But I would have seen
the region or place whereout the hill was graven, and I could not.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,8);</script>And after this I
beheld, and, lo, all they which were gathered together to subdue him were
sore afraid, and yet durst fight.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,9);</script>And, lo, as he saw the
violence of the multitude that came, he neither lifted up his hand, nor
held sword, nor any instrument of war:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,10);</script>But only I saw that
he sent out of his mouth as it had been a blast of fire, and out of his
lips a flaming breath, and out of his tongue he cast out sparks and
tempests.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,11);</script>And they were all
mixed together; the blast of fire, the flaming breath, and the great
tempest; and fell with violence upon the multitude which was prepared to
fight, and burned them up every one, so that upon a sudden of an
innumerable multitude nothing was to be perceived, but only dust and smell
of smoke: when I saw this I was afraid.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,12);</script>Afterward saw I the
same man come down from the mountain, and call unto him another peaceable
Multitude.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,13);</script>And there came much
people unto him, whereof some were glad, some were sorry, and some of them
were bound, and other some brought of them that were offered: then was I
sick through great fear, and I awaked, and said,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,14);</script>Thou hast shewed thy
servant these wonders from the beginning, and hast counted me worthy that
thou shouldest receive my prayer:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,15);</script>Shew me now yet the
interpretation of this dream.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,16);</script>For as I conceive in
mine understanding, woe unto them that shall be left in those days and
much more woe unto them that are not left behind!
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,17);</script>For they that were
not left were in heaviness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,18);</script>Now understand I the
things that are laid up in the latter days, which shall happen unto them,
and to those that are left behind.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,19);</script>Therefore are they
come into great perils and many necessities, like as these dreams declare.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,20);</script>Yet is it easier for
him that is in danger to come into these things, than to pass away as a
cloud out of the world, and not to see the things that happen in the last
days. And he answered unto me, and said,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,21);</script>The interpretation of
the vision shall I shew thee, and I will open unto thee the thing that
thou hast required.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,22);</script>Whereas thou hast
spoken of them that are left behind, this is the interpretation:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,23);</script>He that shall endure
the peril in that time hath kept himself: they that be fallen into danger
are such as have works, and faith toward the Almighty.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,24);</script>Know this therefore,
that they which be left behind are more blessed than they that be dead.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,25);</script>This is the meaning
of the vision: Whereas thou sawest a man coming up from the midst of the
sea:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,26);</script>The same is he whom
God the Highest hath kept a great season, which by his own self shall
deliver his creature: and he shall order them that are left behind.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,27);</script>And whereas thou
sawest, that out of his mouth there came as a blast of wind, and fire, and
storm;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,28);</script>And that he held
neither sword, nor any instrument of war, but that the rushing in of him
destroyed the whole multitude that came to subdue him; this is the
interpretation:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,29);</script>Behold, the days
come, when the most High will begin to deliver them that are upon the
earth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,30);</script>And he shall come to
the astonishment of them that dwell on the earth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,31);</script>And one shall
undertake to fight against another, one city against another, one place
against another, one people against another, and one realm against another.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,32);</script>And the time shall be
when these things shall come to pass, and the signs shall happen which I
shewed thee before, and then shall my Son be declared, whom thou sawest as
a man ascending.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,33);</script>And when all the
people hear his voice, every man shall in their own land leave the battle
they have one against another.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,34);</script>And an innumerable
multitude shall be gathered together, as thou sawest them, willing to
come, and to overcome him by fighting.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,35);</script>But he shall stand
upon the top of the mount Sion.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,36);</script>And Sion shall come,
and shall be shewed to all men, being prepared and builded, like as thou
sawest the hill graven without hands.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,37);</script>And this my Son shall
rebuke the wicked inventions of those nations, which for their wicked life
are fallen into the tempest;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,38);</script>And shall lay before
them their evil thoughts, and the torments wherewith they shall begin to
be tormented, which are like unto a flame: and he shall destroy them
without labour by the law which is like unto me.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,39);</script>And whereas thou
sawest that he gathered another peaceable multitude unto him;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,40);</script>Those are the ten
tribes, which were carried away prisoners out of their own land in the
time of Osea the king, whom Salmanasar the king of Assyria led away
captive, and he carried them over the waters, and so came they into
another land.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,41);</script>But they took this
counsel among themselves, that they would leave the multitude of the
heathen, and go forth into a further country, where never mankind dwelt,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,42);</script>That they might there
keep their statutes, which they never kept in their own land.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,43);</script>And they entered into
Euphrates by the narrow places of the river.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,44);</script>For the most High
then shewed signs for them, and held still the flood, till they were
passed over.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,45);</script>For through that
country there was a great way to go, namely, of a year and a half: and the
same region is called Arsareth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,46);</script>Then dwelt they there
until the latter time; and now when they shall begin to come,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,47);</script>The Highest shall
stay the springs of the stream again, that they may go through: therefore
sawest thou the multitude with peace.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,48);</script>But those that be
left behind of thy people are they that are found within my borders.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,49);</script>Now when he
destroyeth the multitude of the nations that are gathered together, he
shall defend his people that remain.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,50);</script>And then shall he
shew them great wonders.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,51);</script>Then said I, O Lord
that bearest rule, shew me this: Wherefore have I seen the man coming up
from the midst of the sea?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,52);</script>And he said unto me,
Like as thou canst neither seek out nor know the things that are in the
deep of the sea: even so can no man upon earth see my Son, or those that
be with him, but in the day time.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,53);</script>This is the
interpretation of the dream which thou sawest, and whereby thou only art
here lightened.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,54);</script>For thou hast
forsaken thine own way, and applied thy diligence unto my law, and sought
it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,55);</script>Thy life hast thou
ordered in wisdom, and hast called understanding thy mother.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,56);</script>And therefore have I
shewed thee the treasures of the Highest: after other three days I will
speak other things unto thee, and declare unto thee mighty and wondrous
things.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,57);</script>Then went I forth
into the field, giving praise and thanks greatly unto the most High
because of his wonders which he did in time;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,58);</script>And because he
governeth the same, and such things as fall in their seasons: and there I
sat three days.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,1);</script>And it came to pass
upon the third day, I sat under an oak, and, behold, there came a voice
out of a bush over against me, and said, Esdras, Esdras.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,2);</script>And I said, Here am I,
Lord And I stood up upon my feet.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,3);</script>Then said he unto me,
In the bush I did manifestly reveal myself unto Moses, and talked with
him, when my people served in Egypt:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,4);</script>And I sent him and led
my people out of Egypt, and brought him up to the mount of where I held
him by me a long season,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,5);</script>And told him many
wondrous things, and shewed him the secrets of the times, and the end; and
commanded him, saying,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,6);</script>These words shalt thou
declare, and these shalt thou hide.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,7);</script>And now I say unto
thee,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,8);</script>That thou lay up in
thy heart the signs that I have shewed, and the dreams that thou hast
seen, and the interpretations which thou hast heard:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,9);</script>For thou shalt be
taken away from all, and from henceforth thou shalt remain with my Son,
and with such as be like thee, until the times be ended.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,10);</script>For the world hath
lost his youth, and the times begin to wax old.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,11);</script>For the world is
divided into twelve parts, and the ten parts of it are gone already, and
half of a tenth part:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,12);</script>And there remaineth
that which is after the half of the tenth part.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,13);</script>Now therefore set
thine house in order, and reprove thy people, comfort such of them as be
in trouble, and now renounce corruption,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,14);</script>Let go from thee
mortal thoughts, cast away the burdens of man, put off now the weak nature,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,15);</script>And set aside the
thoughts that are most heavy unto thee, and haste thee to flee from these
times.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,16);</script>For yet greater evils
than those which thou hast seen happen shall be done hereafter.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,17);</script>For look how much the
world shall be weaker through age, so much the more shall evils increase
upon them that dwell therein.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,18);</script>For the time is fled
far away, and leasing is hard at hand: for now hasteth the vision to come,
which thou hast seen.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,19);</script>Then answered I
before thee, and said,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,20);</script>Behold, Lord, I will
go, as thou hast commanded me, and reprove the people which are present:
but they that shall be born afterward, who shall admonish them? thus the
world is set in darkness, and they that dwell therein are without light.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,21);</script>For thy law is burnt,
therefore no man knoweth the things that are done of thee, or the work
that shall begin.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,22);</script>But if I have found
grace before thee, send the Holy Ghost into me, and I shall write all that
hath been done in the world since the beginning, which were written in thy
law, that men may find thy path, and that they which will live in the
latter days may live.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,23);</script>And he answered me,
saying, Go thy way, gather the people together, and say unto them, that
they seek thee not for forty days.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,24);</script>But look thou prepare
thee many box trees, and take with thee Sarea, Dabria, Selemia, Ecanus,
and Asiel, these five which are ready to write swiftly;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,25);</script>And come hither, and
I shall light a candle of understanding in thine heart, which shall not be
put out, till the things be performed which thou shalt begin to write.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,26);</script>And when thou hast
done, some things shalt thou publish, and some things shalt thou shew
secretly to the wise: to morrow this hour shalt thou begin to write.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,27);</script>Then went I forth, as
he commanded, and gathered all the people together, and said,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,28);</script>Hear these words, O
Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,29);</script>Our fathers at the
beginning were strangers in Egypt, from whence they were delivered:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,30);</script>And received the law
of life, which they kept not, which ye also have transgressed after them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,31);</script>Then was the land,
even the land of Sion, parted among you by lot: but your fathers, and ye
yourselves, have done unrighteousness, and have not kept the ways which
the Highest commanded you.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,32);</script>And forasmuch as he
is a righteous judge, he took from you in time the thing that he had given
you.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,33);</script>And now are ye here,
and your brethren among you.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,34);</script>Therefore if so be
that ye will subdue your own understanding, and reform your hearts, ye
shall be kept alive and after death ye shall obtain mercy.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,35);</script>For after death shall
the judgment come, when we shall live again: and then shall the names of
the righteous be manifest, and the works of the ungodly shall be declared.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,36);</script>Let no man therefore
come unto me now, nor seek after me these forty days.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,37);</script>So I took the five
men, as he commanded me, and we went into the field, and remained there.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,38);</script>And the next day,
behold, a voice called me, saying, Esdras, open thy mouth, and drink that
I give thee to drink.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,39);</script>Then opened I my
mouth, and, behold, he reached me a full cup, which was full as it were
with water, but the colour of it was like fire.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,40);</script>And I took it, and
drank: and when I had drunk of it, my heart uttered understanding, and
wisdom grew in my breast, for my spirit strengthened my memory:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,41);</script>And my mouth was
opened, and shut no more.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,42);</script>The Highest gave
understanding unto the five men, and they wrote the wonderful visions of
the night that were told, which they knew not: and they sat forty days,
and they wrote in the day, and at night they ate bread.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,43);</script>As for me. I spake in
the day, and I held not my tongue by night.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,44);</script>In forty days they
wrote two hundred and four books.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,45);</script>And it came to pass,
when the forty days were filled, that the Highest spake, saying, The first
that thou hast written publish openly, that the worthy and unworthy may
read it:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,46);</script>But keep the seventy
last, that thou mayest deliver them only to such as be wise among the
people:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,47);</script>For in them is the
spring of understanding, the fountain of wisdom, and the stream of
knowledge.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,48);</script>And I did so.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,1);</script>Behold, speak thou in
the ears of my people the words of prophecy, which I will put in thy
mouth, saith the Lord:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,2);</script>And cause them to be
written in paper: for they are faithful and true.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,3);</script>Fear not the
imaginations against thee, let not the incredulity of them trouble thee,
that speak against thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,4);</script>For all the unfaithful
shall die in their unfaithfulness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,5);</script>Behold, saith the
Lord, I will bring plagues upon the world; the sword, famine, death, and
destruction.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,6);</script>For wickedness hath
exceedingly polluted the whole earth, and their hurtful works are
fulfilled.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,7);</script>Therefore saith the
Lord,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,8);</script>I will hold my tongue
no more as touching their wickedness, which they profanely commit, neither
will I suffer them in those things, in which they wickedly exercise
themselves: behold, the innocent and righteous blood crieth unto me, and
the souls of the just complain continually.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,9);</script>And therefore, saith
the Lord, I will surely avenge them, and receive unto me all the innocent
blood from among them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,10);</script>Behold, my people is
led as a flock to the slaughter: I will not suffer them now to dwell in
the land of Egypt:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,11);</script>But I will bring them
with a mighty hand and a stretched out arm, and smite Egypt with plagues,
as before, and will destroy all the land thereof.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,12);</script>Egypt shall mourn,
and the foundation of it shall be smitten with the plague and punishment
that God shall bring upon it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,13);</script>They that till the
ground shall mourn: for their seeds shall fail through the blasting and
hail, and with a fearful constellation.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,14);</script>Woe to the world and
them that dwell therein!
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,15);</script>For the sword and
their destruction draweth nigh, and one people shall stand up and fight
against another, and swords in their hands.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,16);</script>For there shall be
sedition among men, and invading one another; they shall not regard their
kings nor princes, and the course of their actions shall stand in their
power.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,17);</script>A man shall desire to
go into a city, and shall not be able.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,18);</script>For because of their
pride the cities shall be troubled, the houses shall be destroyed, and men
shall be afraid.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,19);</script>A man shall have no
pity upon his neighbour, but shall destroy their houses with the sword,
and spoil their goods, because of the lack of bread, and for great
tribulation.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,20);</script>Behold, saith God, I
will call together all the kings of the earth to reverence me, which are
from the rising of the sun, from the south, from the east, and Libanus; to
turn themselves one against another, and repay the things that they have
done to them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,21);</script>Like as they do yet
this day unto my chosen, so will I do also, and recompense in their bosom.
Thus saith the Lord God;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,22);</script>My right hand shall
not spare the sinners, and my sword shall not cease over them that shed
innocent blood upon the earth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,23);</script>The fire is gone
forth from his wrath, and hath consumed the foundations of the earth, and
the sinners, like the straw that is kindled.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,24);</script>Woe to them that sin,
and keep not my commandments! saith the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,25);</script>I will not spare
them: go your way, ye children, from the power, defile not my sanctuary.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,26);</script>For the Lord knoweth
all them that sin against him, and therefore delivereth he them unto death
and destruction.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,27);</script>For now are the
plagues come upon the whole earth and ye shall remain in them: for God
shall not deliver you, because ye have sinned against him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,28);</script>Behold an horrible
vision, and the appearance thereof from the east:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,29);</script>Where the nations of
the dragons of Arabia shall come out with many chariots, and the multitude
of them shall be carried as the wind upon earth, that all they which hear
them may fear and tremble.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,30);</script>Also the Carmanians
raging in wrath shall go forth as the wild boars of the wood, and with
great power shall they come, and join battle with them, and shall waste a
portion of the land of the Assyrians.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,31);</script>And then shall the
dragons have the upper hand, remembering their nature; and if they shall
turn themselves, conspiring together in great power to persecute them,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,32);</script>Then these shall be
troubled bled, and keep silence through their power, and shall flee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,33);</script>And from the land of
the Assyrians shall the enemy besiege them, and consume some of them, and
in their host shall be fear and dread, and strife among their kings.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,34);</script>Behold clouds from
the east and from the north unto the south, and they are very horrible to
look upon, full of wrath and storm.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,35);</script>They shall smite one
upon another, and they shall smite down a great multitude of stars upon
the earth, even their own star; and blood shall be from the sword unto the
belly,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,36);</script>And dung of men unto
the camel’s hough.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,37);</script>And there shall be
great fearfulness and trembling upon earth: and they that see the wrath
shall be afraid, and trembling shall come upon them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,38);</script>And then shall there
come great storms from the south, and from the north, and another part
from the west.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,39);</script>And strong winds
shall arise from the east, and shall open it; and the cloud which he
raised up in wrath, and the star stirred to cause fear toward the east and
west wind, shall be destroyed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,40);</script>The great and mighty
clouds shall be puffed up full of wrath, and the star, that they may make
all the earth afraid, and them that dwell therein; and they shall pour out
over every high and eminent place an horrible star,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,41);</script>Fire, and hail, and
flying swords, and many waters, that all fields may be full, and all
rivers, with the abundance of great waters.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,42);</script>And they shall break
down the cities and walls, mountains and hills, trees of the wood, and
grass of the meadows, and their corn.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,43);</script>And they shall go
stedfastly unto Babylon, and make her afraid.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,44);</script>They shall come to
her, and besiege her, the star and all wrath shall they pour out upon her:
then shall the dust and smoke go up unto the heaven, and all they that be
about her shall bewail her.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,45);</script>And they that remain
under her shall do service unto them that have put her in fear.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,46);</script>And thou, Asia, that
art partaker of the hope of Babylon, and art the glory of her person:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,47);</script>Woe be unto thee,
thou wretch, because thou hast made thyself like unto her; and hast decked
thy daughters in whoredom, that they might please and glory in thy lovers,
which have always desired to commit whoredom with thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,48);</script>Thou hast followed
her that is hated in all her works and inventions: therefore saith God,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,49);</script>I will send plagues
upon thee; widowhood, poverty, famine, sword, and pestilence, to waste thy
houses with destruction and death.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,50);</script>And the glory of thy
Power shall be dried up as a flower, the heat shall arise that is sent
over thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,51);</script>Thou shalt be
weakened as a poor woman with stripes, and as one chastised with wounds,
so that the mighty and lovers shall not be able to receive thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,52);</script>Would I with jealousy
have so proceeded against thee, saith the Lord,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,53);</script>If thou hadst not
always slain my chosen, exalting the stroke of thine hands, and saying
over their dead, when thou wast drunken,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,54);</script>Set forth the beauty
of thy countenance?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,55);</script>The reward of thy
whoredom shall be in thy bosom, therefore shalt thou receive recompence.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,56);</script>Like as thou hast
done unto my chosen, saith the Lord, even so shall God do unto thee, and
shall deliver thee into mischief
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,57);</script>Thy children shall
die of hunger, and thou shalt fall through the sword: thy cities shall be
broken down, and all thine shall perish with the sword in the field.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,58);</script>They that be in the
mountains shall die of hunger, and eat their own flesh, and drink their
own blood, for very hunger of bread, and thirst of water.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,59);</script>Thou as unhappy shalt
come through the sea, and receive plagues again.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,60);</script>And in the passage
they shall rush on the idle city, and shall destroy some portion of thy
land, and consume part of thy glory, and shall return to Babylon that was
destroyed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,61);</script>And thou shalt be
cast down by them as stubble, and they shall be unto thee as fire;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,62);</script>And shall consume
thee, and thy cities, thy land, and thy mountains; all thy woods and thy
fruitful trees shall they burn up with fire.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,63);</script>Thy children shall
they carry away captive, and, look, what thou hast, they shall spoil it,
and mar the beauty of thy face.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,1);</script>Woe be unto thee,
Babylon, and Asia! woe be unto thee, Egypt and Syria!
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,2);</script>Gird up yourselves
with cloths of sack and hair, bewail your children, and be sorry; for your
destruction is at hand.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,3);</script>A sword is sent upon
you, and who may turn it back?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,4);</script>A fire is sent among
you, and who may quench it?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,5);</script>Plagues are sent unto
you, and what is he that may drive them away?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,6);</script>May any man drive away
an hungry lion in the wood? or may any one quench the fire in stubble,
when it hath begun to burn?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,7);</script>May one turn again the
arrow that is shot of a strong archer?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,8);</script>The mighty Lord
sendeth the plagues and who is he that can drive them away?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,9);</script>A fire shall go forth
from his wrath, and who is he that may quench it?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,10);</script>He shall cast
lightnings, and who shall not fear? he shall thunder, and who shall not be
afraid?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,11);</script>The Lord shall
threaten, and who shall not be utterly beaten to powder at his presence?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,12);</script>The earth quaketh,
and the foundations thereof; the sea ariseth up with waves from the deep,
and the waves of it are troubled, and the fishes thereof also, before the
Lord, and before the glory of his power:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,13);</script>For strong is his
right hand that bendeth the bow, his arrows that he shooteth are sharp,
and shall not miss, when they begin to be shot into the ends of the world.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,14);</script>Behold, the plagues
are sent, and shall not return again, until they come upon the earth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,15);</script>The fire is kindled,
and shall not be put out, till it consume the foundation of the earth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,16);</script>Like as an arrow
which is shot of a mighty archer returneth not backward: even so the
plagues that shall be sent upon earth shall not return again.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,17);</script>Woe is me! woe is me!
who will deliver me in those days?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,18);</script>The beginning of
sorrows and great mournings; the beginning of famine and great death; the
beginning of wars, and the powers shall stand in fear; the beginning of
evils! what shall I do when these evils shall come?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,19);</script>Behold, famine and
plague, tribulation and anguish, are sent as scourges for amendment.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,20);</script>But for all these
things they shall not turn from their wickedness, nor be always mindful of
the scourges.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,21);</script>Behold, victuals
shall be so good cheap upon earth, that they shall think themselves to be
in good case, and even then shall evils grow upon earth, sword, famine,
and great confusion.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,22);</script>For many of them that
dwell upon earth shall perish of famine; and the other, that escape the
hunger, shall the sword destroy.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,23);</script>And the dead shall be
cast out as dung, and there shall be no man to comfort them: for the earth
shall be wasted, and the cities shall be cast down.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,24);</script>There shall be no man
left to till the earth, and to sow it
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,25);</script>The trees shall give
fruit, and who shall gather them?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,26);</script>The grapes shall
ripen, and who shall tread them? for all places shall be desolate of men:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,27);</script>So that one man shall
desire to see another, and to hear his voice.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,28);</script>For of a city there
shall be ten left, and two of the field, which shall hide themselves in
the thick groves, and in the clefts of the rocks.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,29);</script>As in an orchard of
Olives upon every tree there are left three or four olives;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,30);</script>Or as when a vineyard
is gathered, there are left some clusters of them that diligently seek
through the vineyard:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,31);</script>Even so in those days
there shall be three or four left by them that search their houses with
the sword.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,32);</script>And the earth shall
be laid waste, and the fields thereof shall wax old, and her ways and all
her paths shall grow full of thorns, because no man shall travel
therethrough.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,33);</script>The virgins shall
mourn, having no bridegrooms; the women shall mourn, having no husbands;
their daughters shall mourn, having no helpers.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,34);</script>In the wars shall
their bridegrooms be destroyed, and their husbands shall perish of famine.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,35);</script>Hear now these things
and understand them, ye servants of the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,36);</script>Behold, the word of
the Lord, receive it: believe not the gods of whom the Lord spake.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,37);</script>Behold, the plagues
draw nigh, and are not slack.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,38);</script>As when a woman with
child in the ninth month bringeth forth her son, with two or three hours
of her birth great pains compass her womb, which pains, when the child
cometh forth, they slack not a moment:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,39);</script>Even so shall not the
plagues be slack to come upon the earth, and the world shall mourn, and
sorrows shall come upon it on every side.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,40);</script>O my people, hear my
word: make you ready to thy battle, and in those evils be even as pilgrims
upon the earth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,41);</script>He that selleth, let
him be as he that fleeth away: and he that buyeth, as one that will lose:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,42);</script>He that occupieth
merchandise, as he that hath no profit by it: and he that buildeth, as he
that shall not dwell therein:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,43);</script>He that soweth, as if
he should not reap: so also he that planteth the vineyard, as he that
shall not gather the grapes:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,44);</script>They that marry, as
they that shall get no children; and they that marry not, as the widowers.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,45);</script>And therefore they
that labour labour in vain:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,46);</script>For strangers shall
reap their fruits, and spoil their goods, overthrow their houses, and take
their children captives, for in captivity and famine shall they get
children.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,47);</script>And they that occupy
their merchandise with robbery, the more they deck their cities, their
houses, their possessions, and their own persons:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,48);</script>The more will I be
angry with them for their sin, saith the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,49);</script>Like as a whore
envieth a right honest and virtuous woman:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,50);</script>So shall
righteousness hate iniquity, when she decketh herself, and shall accuse
her to her face, when he cometh that shall defend him that diligently
searcheth out every sin upon earth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,51);</script>And therefore be ye
not like thereunto, nor to the works thereof.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,52);</script>For yet a little, and
iniquity shall be taken away out of the earth, and righteousness shall
reign among you.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,53);</script>Let not the sinner
say that he hath not sinned: for God shall burn coals of fire upon his
head, which saith before the Lord God and his glory, I have not sinned.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,54);</script>Behold, the Lord
knoweth all the works of men, their imaginations, their thoughts, and
their hearts:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,55);</script>Which spake but the
word, Let the earth be made; and it was made: Let the heaven be made; and
it was created.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,56);</script>In his word were the
stars made, and he knoweth the number of them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,57);</script>He searcheth the
deep, and the treasures thereof; he hath measured the sea, and what it
containeth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,58);</script>He hath shut the sea
in the midst of the waters, and with his word hath he hanged the earth
upon the waters.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,59);</script>He spreadeth out the
heavens like a vault; upon the waters hath he founded it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,60);</script>In the desert hath he
made springs of water, and pools upon the tops of the mountains, that the
floods might pour down from the high rocks to water the earth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,61);</script>He made man, and put
his heart in the midst of the body, and gave him breath, life, and
understanding.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,62);</script>Yea and the Spirit of
Almighty God, which made all things, and searcheth out all hidden things
in the secrets of the earth,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,63);</script>Surely he knoweth
your inventions, and what ye think in your hearts, even them that sin, and
would hide their sin.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,64);</script>Therefore hath the
Lord exactly searched out all your works, and he will put you all to shame.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,65);</script>And when your sins
are brought forth, ye shall be ashamed before men, and your own sins shall
be your accusers in that day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,66);</script>What will ye do? or
how will ye hide your sins before God and his angels?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,67);</script>Behold, God himself
is the judge, fear him: leave off from your sins, and forget your
iniquities, to meddle no more with them for ever: so shall God lead you
forth, and deliver you from all trouble.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,68);</script>For, behold, the
burning wrath of a great multitude is kindled over you, and they shall
take away certain of you, and feed you, being idle, with things offered
unto idols.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,69);</script>And they that consent
unto them shall be had in derision and in reproach, and trodden under foot.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,70);</script>For there shall be in
every place, and in the next cities, a great insurrection upon those that
fear the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,71);</script>They shall be like
mad men, sparing none, but still spoiling and destroying those that fear
the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,72);</script>For they shall waste
and take away their goods, and cast them out of their houses.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,73);</script>Then shall they be
known, who are my chosen; and they shall be tried as the gold in the fire.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,74);</script>Hear, O ye my
beloved, saith the Lord: behold, the days of trouble are at hand, but I
will deliver you from the same.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,75);</script>Be ye not afraid
neither doubt; for God is your guide,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,76);</script>And the guide of them
who keep my commandments and precepts, saith the Lord God: let not your
sins weigh you down, and let not your iniquities lift up themselves.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,77);</script>Woe be unto them that
are bound with their sins, and covered with their iniquities like as a
field is covered over with bushes, and the path thereof covered with
thorns, that no man may travel through!
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,78);</script>It is left undressed,
and is cast into the fire to be consumed therewith.
