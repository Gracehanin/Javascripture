The Prayer of Azariah
</h1><p>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,1);</script>And they walked in the
midst of the fire, praising God, and blessing the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,2);</script>Then Azarias stood up,
and prayed on this manner; and opening his mouth in the midst of the fire
said,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,3);</script>Blessed art thou, O
Lord God of our fathers: thy name is worthy to be praised and glorified
for evermore:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,4);</script>For thou art righteous
in all the things that thou hast done to us: yea, true are all thy works,
thy ways are right, and all thy judgments truth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,5);</script>In all the things that
thou hast brought upon us, and upon the holy city of our fathers, even
Jerusalem, thou hast executed true judgment: for according to truth and
judgment didst thou bring all these things upon us because of our sins.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,6);</script>For we have sinned and
committed iniquity, departing from thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,7);</script>In all things have we
trespassed, and not obeyed thy commandments, nor kept them, neither done
as thou hast commanded us, that it might go well with us.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,8);</script>Wherefore all that thou
hast brought upon us, and every thing that thou hast done to us, thou hast
done in true judgment.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,9);</script>And thou didst deliver
us into the hands of lawless enemies, most hateful forsakers of God, and
to an unjust king, and the most wicked in all the world.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,10);</script>And now we cannot open
our mouths, we are become a shame and reproach to thy servants; and to
them that worship thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,11);</script>Yet deliver us not up
wholly, for thy name’s sake, neither disannul thou thy covenant:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,12);</script>And cause not thy
mercy to depart from us, for thy beloved Abraham’s sake, for thy servant
Issac’s sake, and for thy holy Israel’s sake;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,13);</script>To whom thou hast
spoken and promised, that thou wouldest multiply their seed as the stars
of heaven, and as the sand that lieth upon the seashore.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,14);</script>For we, O Lord, are
become less than any nation, and be kept under this day in all the world
because of our sins.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,15);</script>Neither is there at
this time prince, or prophet, or leader, or burnt offering, or sacrifice,
or oblation, or incense, or place to sacrifice before thee, and to find
mercy.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,16);</script>Nevertheless in a
contrite heart and an humble spirit let us be accepted.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,17);</script>Like as in the burnt
offerings of rams and bullocks, and like as in ten thousands of fat lambs:
so let our sacrifice be in thy sight this day, and grant that we may
wholly go after thee: for they shall not be confounded that put their
trust in thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,18);</script>And now we follow thee
with all our heart, we fear thee, and seek thy face.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,19);</script>Put us not to shame:
but deal with us after thy lovingkindness, and according to the multitude
of thy mercies.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,20);</script>Deliver us also
according to thy marvellous works, and give glory to thy name, O Lord: and
let all them that do thy servants hurt be ashamed;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,21);</script>And let them be
confounded in all their power and might, and let their strength be broken;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,22);</script>And let them know that
thou art God, the only God, and glorious over the whole world.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,23);</script>And the king’s
servants, that put them in, ceased not to make the oven hot with rosin,
pitch, tow, and small wood;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,24);</script>So that the flame
streamed forth above the furnace forty and nine cubits.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,25);</script>And it passed through,
and burned those Chaldeans it found about the furnace.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,26);</script>But the angel of the
Lord came down into the oven together with Azarias and his fellows, and
smote the flame of the fire out of the oven;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,27);</script>And made the midst of
the furnace as it had been a moist whistling wind, so that the fire
touched them not at all, neither hurt nor troubled them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,28);</script>Then the three, as out
of one mouth, praised, glorified, and blessed, God in the furnace, saying,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,29);</script>Blessed art thou, O
Lord God of our fathers: and to be praised and exalted above all for ever.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,30);</script>And blessed is thy
glorious and holy name: and to be praised and exalted above all for ever.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,31);</script>Blessed art thou in
the temple of thine holy glory: and to be praised and glorified above all
for ever.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,32);</script>Blessed art thou that
beholdest the depths, and sittest upon the cherubims: and to be praised
and exalted above all for ever.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,33);</script>Blessed art thou on
the glorious throne of thy kingdom: and to be praised and glorified above
all for ever.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,34);</script>Blessed art thou in
the firmament of heaven: and above all to be praised and glorified for
ever.
